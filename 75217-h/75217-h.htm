<span class="fs70">TED TAKES A POST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The noon whistles blew in the little inland
town of Ridgefield and the sound, flung from
many a hoarse factory siren, reached the ears
of the few men who worked at piling lumber
in Thorn’s Lumber and Millwork Company
yard. The work of the men was instantly suspended
and most of them walked off to look
into well-filled lunch pails. A few, fortunate
enough to live close by, started off for their
homes.</p>

<p>At the first sound of the whistles two clean-cut
young fellows at the far end of the yard
had just lifted a long plank, preparatory to
tossing it on a towering pile beside them. They
looked smilingly at each other as the whistles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
joined by others, increased in volume of sound.</p>

<p>“That’s what we have been listening for!”
smiled Ted Thorn, son of the owner of the lumber
yard.</p>

<p>“Be careful!” warned Buck Dalton, his constant
companion and devoted chum. “You will
come under the heading of a whistle-listener!
That’s the next worse thing to being a clockwatcher!”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it,” grinned Ted. “My stomach
has been listening for that sound for some time
past.”</p>

<p>“Mine has, too,” confessed Buck. “Let’s
heave this last board up.”</p>

<p>With a concerted heave they sent the long
board flying upward to the top of the pile and
then, after washing at the nearby faucet, they
set off for home and the noon meal. It was a
noontime in late July and as they walked along
they talked of summer plans.</p>

<p>“I hope we can get in some camping before
long,” Ted said, as they turned down the shady
street upon which they both lived. “We’ve
made a little extra money this summer so far
and we’re in fine shape for the football season
this year. I think that it is time we knocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
off our work and figured on a little camping
trip.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you on that,” nodded Buck.
“I’m just about ready for a good outdoor trip
and a few weeks under canvas. There is nothing
I like as well as the woods and a tent.”</p>

<p>“That, and a fire which glows a dull red,”
cried Ted, his eyes shining.</p>

<p>“You bet! Well, here’s your gate, so the
best of friends must part. See you after dinner.”</p>

<p>Ted Thorn went into the plain old house while
Buckley Dalton continued on his way to a house
a little way further along the street. These two
boys had been loyal comrades since they had
been old enough to play together. Ted was the
son of the owner of the local lumber yard, a
man of quiet personality and moderate means,
who was wrapped up in the lives of his two
children and his wife. Ted’s sister Dorothy
was one year his junior and his companion of
more than one good time in the events of the
local school. The household was a happy one
and in such an atmosphere Ted had grown up
to be a clean-cut, manly fellow, now eighteen,
and about to enter upon the last year at the
local academy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Buck was Ted’s age and was a worthy companion,
a fun-loving fellow who was honest and
generous to the core. In physical proportions
he passed Ted, weighing a few pounds more and
being gifted with a wider span of shoulders.
Both of the boys had been working throughout
the summer at Ted’s father’s lumber yard, to
store up a little money to their accounts at the
bank and to keep themselves in trim for the
coming football season. On the Ridgefield
Academy team Buck played fullback and Ted
had been for the past two years the quarterback
of the team. It was the intention of the boys
to work at least a month or more and then to
spend some time during the summer on a camping
trip, to round off their summer training in
that way. Now, with August near at hand, they
were beginning to think more seriously of the
trip into the woods.</p>

<p>Ted entered the house quickly and washed
up, after which he reported to the dining room
table. His father and mother were there,
though his sister was visiting at another house.
With all the evidence of a healthy appetite Ted
attacked the food which his mother placed
before him.</p>

<p>“The foreman tells me that you and Buck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
are becoming first class men,” his father, a
middle-aged man with heavy gray hair, told
him.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear that,” Ted smiled. “When we
first started to work at the yard it seemed that
all we could do was to collect sore hands and
blisters! I guess that after we finish at the
academy you may be able to hire us for good,
Dad!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if you might be able to
do something else beside pile lumber, after you
graduate from the academy,” returned his
father.</p>

<p>“Hope so,” his son said. “Pretty soon we’ll
have to pick out a preparatory school or college
for me, won’t we Dad?”</p>

<p>“In another six months,” his father nodded,
deriving pleasure from the thought. The fact
that Ted was going to college outweighed the
thought of personal expense with Mr. Thorn.</p>

<p>“Ted, there was a telephone call for you today,”
his mother, a fine looking, sweet-faced
woman, put in. “Mr. Calvert called up and left
a message for you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Calvert?” frowned Ted. “Let’s see,
he’s the president of the Boys’ Club of the town,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and also a prominent lawyer,” replied
his father. “I wonder what he wants you for?”</p>

<p>“Can’t guess,” Ted shook his head. “What
message did he leave, Mother?”</p>

<p>“He asked to tell you to get in touch with
him as soon as possible,” she replied.</p>

<p>“All right, I will. I suppose I had better
go to his house this evening.”</p>

<p>“Go to his office this afternoon,” his father
said. “It may be something important and
there is no use keeping Mr. Calvert waiting. I
guess the lumber yard can spare you for a little
while.”</p>

<p>“I guess you won’t lose any money while I’m
gone,” grinned Ted. “All right, I’ll call him
and make an appointment with him for this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>After the noon meal Ted called up the lawyer
and made an appointment with him for an early
hour. He then went out to the gate and waited
for Buck to come by. In a few moments his
chum came swinging along the street.</p>

<p>“Come on, back to the field of battle,” he
called, gaily.</p>

<p>“You go ahead,” Ted advised him. “I won’t
be over there right away. I’ve got an appointment
with Lawyer Calvert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>They discussed the item for a few moments
before they parted. “He must want you for
something pretty important,” Buck thought.
“Maybe he wants you to work for him during
the rest of the summer.”</p>

<p>“If that is what he wants, he won’t get it,”
Ted shook his head. “I’m going camping with
you, Buck old boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be foolish about that,” Buck
advised. “We can go camping some other
time, you know, and Mr. Calvert doesn’t offer
jobs every day.”</p>

<p>“We’re getting a bit ahead of the game,”
Ted smiled. “We don’t know yet what he does
want. I’ll see you later in the day and tell
you all about it.”</p>

<p>Buck went on the way returning to his work
in the lumber yard, while Ted waited until it
was time to go downtown to see the lawyer.
Promptly at the appointed hour he reported at
the office of Mr. Calvert and after his name had
been sent in, he was admitted to the presence of
the man.</p>

<p>Ted had seen Mr. Calvert before but he was
not personally acquainted with him. The lawyer
was a fine, upstanding man, a power in the
little community, and a great lover of boys and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
their activities. Ted was a little surprised when
the handsome, middle-aged lawyer got up from
his deep leather chair and smilingly shook
hands with him.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Thorn!” he asked, giving
Ted a hearty pressure of the hand. “I’m glad
you found the opportunity to drop in and visit
me. I suppose you have no idea why I sent for
you!”</p>

<p>“None at all, sir,” Ted confessed.</p>

<p>“Take a seat,” the lawyer directed, and when
Ted had seated himself opposite him the man
went straight to the point.</p>

<p>“Thorn, you know that I am president of
the Boys’ Club of this town, an organization of
young fellows numbering about twenty young
fellows, all pretty wide-awake boys who are
banding their activities together and learning
some pretty useful things in life. These boys
are younger than you are and that is the reason
that you and some of your particular friends
have never been asked to join. Well, the time
has come when these boys are asking for a
regular summer camping trip, and the officers
of the club have agreed that the boys shall have
a month of camping life this year, under the
direction of the club. We want some one trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
to take these boys off on a camping trip
and take care of them, and we feel that we
couldn’t get a better leader than you.”</p>

<p>Ted’s face flushed with pleasure but he hesitated,
questions surging in his mind. “That’s
a very kind thought, Mr. Calvert,” he said.
“But don’t you think I am a little young?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, and besides, you’d have help.
We know that you travel constantly in the company
of Buckley Dalton and if you accept the
post, we want your comrade to go with you.
Between the two of you, you’d have no trouble
in handling the boys. You speak of being young.
Well, we wouldn’t consider anyone as young as
you are unless he was the power among younger
fellows that you are. For the past two years
you have been quarterback on the academy
team, and the boys in the club have looked at
you with eyes of worship! Your clean playing,
your clear head work on the field, has captured
their imagination so that they will hop with
joy when they are told that you will lead the
camping trip. We propose to pay you and
Buck a small salary for your work. How about
it, Thorn?”</p>

<p>“On one condition,” said Ted, instantly.</p>

<p>“What is that?” Calvert asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“That you withdraw what you said about the
salary. Buck and I were planning to go for a
camping trip very soon and this plan which you
propose would simply be a bigger trip than we
had planned. If you pay all expenses for food,
as I suppose you will, that will be enough.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Thorn! If we hired a professional
man, we’d have to pay him,” the lawyer
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’re not professionals. Buck and
I have camped before, and this trip will be a
new experience for us. Now, if our food and
equipment is to be furnished, Buck and I will
be saving, and that will be plenty as it is.
How do you know that we’ll make a success of
it?”</p>

<p>“The men in this town notice a thing or two,
Thorn,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>“This is something new,” Ted said. “But
we’ll try it—with no salary! I think we’ll both
feel more like doing the job right if we do it
for the benefit of the club and the boys, than
if we do it because we are paid for it. The
Boys’ Club is a fine institution, and Buck and
I will be glad to help it along.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your good spirit,” smiled the
lawyer. “I am glad that we are able to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
leaders like you two. And now I want to speak
to you about the camping site.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering where the camp would be,”
Ted nodded.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of Black Riders’
Camp?” the lawyer asked.</p>

<p>Ted considered. “That is the place where
a number of patriots used to meet in a band at
the time of the Revolutionary War, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Calvert nodded. “Yes. This state played
a big part in the Revolution and a band of
mounted men, known as the Black Riders, used
to meet in a camp near here and sally forth to
worry the British all over the countryside. That
camp is now owned by the members of the
Boys’ Club Trustee Board, and it is on that
spot that we wish the camp to be pitched. A
large and beautiful stream of water, called Bear
Creek, runs through the hollow where the camp
was, there is an excellent natural swimming
hole, and all in all the spot is ideal, except in
one particular.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” replied Mr. Calvert slowly.
“The camp of the Black Riders is said to
be a haunted spot!”</p>

<span class="fs70">IN THE CAMP OF THE BLACK RIDERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“The camp is haunted!” Ted asked, quickly,
leaning forward in interest.</p>

<p>Mr. Calvert smiled. “It is said to be, at any
rate. There are all sorts of foolish stories connected
with the place, and I have no doubt that
people residing in the surrounding country
could tell you many of them. It is all probably
nonsense, but I thought it better to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Do any of the boys who are going on the
camping trip know that the camp is supposedly
haunted?”</p>

<p>“As far as I know they don’t, but they will
be told of it by someone. You may have a little
difficulty on that score, but not much, I think.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that we will,” affirmed Ted.
“Most of the boys are sensible fellows and they
will take care of the rest. The camp is some
little distance away from here, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“About forty miles. Some of the parents
may wonder why we select a spot so far away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
but there is not much real fun out of a camping
trip unless the camp is some distance away.
There are other spots nearer, but none of them
is as ideal as the Black Riders’ Camp, and the
trustees wish that particular spot to be used.
The creek that runs through the natural basin
has a fine curve in it which makes the swimming
hole I spoke of and seldom have I seen anything
to even equal it for attractiveness. If our boys
get a month in a place like that, with constant
outdoor work and play, I’m sure that it will do
them a world of good.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of it,” Ted agreed. “I’m
very glad to be in on the thing. Buck and I
have had enough camping experience to swing
the job and I think we’ll both enjoy the experience
of handling a big crowd instead of
just a few fellows. How will we get to the
place?”</p>

<p>“A couple of trucks will take you there and
all of the necessary equipment will be provided.
Anytime that you desire fresh food you can
call me up and it will be sent. I’m very glad
that you are going, Thorn, because I feel sure
that the camp will be in the hands of two trustworthy
fellows. I wasn’t sure whether your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
friend Buck would be free to go along and so I
only asked you to come and see me.”</p>

<p>“Buck will be glad to go along,” smiled Ted.
“We don’t go very many places without each
other! By the way, do you think it would be
wise for me to run out and look over Black
Riders’ Camp before the camp actually settles
there?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be an excellent idea. Take
the Black Horse Pike out past Montvery, turn
off on a dirt road which you will find on your
left as you leave Montvery, and you’ll have
no trouble locating the camp. If you see the
site of the location you will have no trouble in
setting up camp, because you have time ahead
to figure out space.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll do that. How soon will the
boys be ready to go?”</p>

<p>“In a week. There are some few details to
be worked out and then everything will be in
readiness.”</p>

<p>After some more talk Ted left the lawyer’s
office, well pleased with the project which
loomed up before him, and made his way quickly
to the lumber yard. The sense of responsibility
which would rest upon him gave him
something serious to think about, but the more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
he thought it out the more it seemed to him that
the experience would be a good one. On the
other camping trips there had always been a
few fellows and every one had had his own
affairs to look out for, but this club camping
trip promised to tax his executive powers.
There would have to be system and obedience
and he liked the prospect of organizing such
a camp.</p>

<p>“Buck and I will learn a whole lot out of this
trip,” he thought, as he entered the lumber
yard.</p>

<p>Buck was in the yard office, busily checking
up on some lumber when Ted came in, and he
looked up with his customary grin. “Here
comes the big boss!” he cried. “Good morning,
Mister Thorn!”</p>

<p>“Good morning is right!” flashed back Ted.
“Arriving to work at three o’clock in the afternoon
is quite a privilege, isn’t it? Never mind,
when you get to be an old and trusted employee,
as I am, you can do the same!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that. What did Mr. Calvert have to
say, if it is for me to know.”</p>

<p>“It is very much for you to know, Buck,”
replied Ted, seating himself on a stool beside
his chum. “You and I have been appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
camp leaders for the Boys’ Club during their
August encampment!”</p>

<p>“Get out! You’re fooling!”</p>

<p>“I thought Mr. Calvert was, but he wasn’t.
No, he wants us to go and take charge of the
camp, which will be out in the woods at the
camp of the Black Riders.”</p>

<p>“Hello, the haunted camp!”</p>

<p>“Where did you hear that it was haunted?”
Ted asked, quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, a cousin of mine told me, but it is just
some foolishment, as our friend Jake Meyers
would say. Some countryman went to sleep
there one time and a rock rolled down hill,
passing close to his head. It was a big rock
and the man wouldn’t believe but that some
ghost or goblin or something did it, and I guess
from that time on there have been stories. They
don’t amount to anything, though.”</p>

<p>“They don’t with us, but I don’t know how
things will be with younger boys. You and I
will have to laugh off any such feelings if they
do get around, and if possible, we must do our
best to see to it that they don’t get around.
You’ve never been there, have you?”</p>

<p>“No. Have you?”</p>

<p>“No, but in accordance with a suggestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
which Mr. Calvert approved, I’m going to run
up there on Saturday afternoon and look the
place over. Want to come along?”</p>

<p>“I won’t be able to, because I’m going visiting
with the family. But you go ahead and look
things over. Now, let’s have the whole story
of what Mr. Calvert said.”</p>

<p>Ted told Buck the arrangements and his companion
was enthusiastic. “We’ll get a good
insight on how to run a big camp,” he declared.
“Of course, in some respects, it won’t be as
much fun as camping alone, because when you
are with one or two fellows you can do pretty
much as you please, but we’ll try our hand at
something new. I’m all for it.”</p>

<p>“I knew you would be, and I told Mr. Calvert
so. What I’ll do is this: I’ll drive up there
in the Rattletrap and look over the spot, to get
a fair idea of the place. Then you and I will
figure out just where we want the tents to go
and how we’ll want things arranged.”</p>

<p>That night the two boys told the news at
their respective homes and the plans for the
rest of the summer were approved. Buck was
the only son of his parents and they were very
proud of their stalwart son. Between the two
families there existed a warm friendship which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
was of years standing. And although Buck
went to Ted’s house presumably to see Ted, it
was no secret that he hoped on each visit to
see Ted’s sister, Dorothy.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday both boys terminated
their work at the mill yard and that
afternoon Ted went to the old barn back of
his house and took out his battered old car,
which he capped with a fitting name when he
termed it the Rattletrap. It was of an ancient
vintage and rattled before each start and halt
with singular energy and application. But it
always went and it had more than once taken
the two boys to school and other events, keeping
to date a record for performance of which
any car might well be proud.</p>

<p>In this old wreck of a car Ted left Ridgefield
and headed out for the Black Horse Pike, one
of the oldest roads in the State. He followed
this for the forty miles which Mr. Calvert had
told him of, and reached the small town of
Montvery. Traversing this same road he passed
through the village and came to a grass-grown
old road that led away toward the encircling
forest. Judging this to be the road in question,
Ted followed it, and after passing about
a half mile of fields, the road dipped into thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
woods. As soon as he left the open grounds
the gloom seemed to wall him in and the woods
were cool.</p>

<p>A farmer was approaching and Ted brought
the Rattletrap to a stop, hailing the man.
“Am I anywhere near the camp of the Black
Riders?”</p>

<p>“Keep going for another half mile,” was
the answer. “Then you’ll get to the end of
the road and you’ll have to hike down the path
into the gully.” He rested his foot on the
runningboard of the shaking car. “Don’t many
people come up to see the camp any more,” he
confided.</p>

<p>“How is that?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, people get tired of lookin’ at nothing
but an open space. If it was a building or
something else it would be different. You going
to take a look at it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ted nodded. “A bunch of fellows
are going to camp there in a week or so.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, you won’t have nobody bothering
you.”</p>

<p>“That is comforting news,” Ted thought, as
he left the farmer and moved on. “That will
be something like real camp life.”</p>

<p>He came to the end of the rough road and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
left the car, starting out on a steadily descending
path until he came at last to the camp of
the Black Riders. Before going to the bottom
of the basin he paused to look around him.
The place was a perfect bowl, the sides of which
were sheathed with fine pine trees. At the
bottom ran Bear Creek with its curve that made
the swimming pool. On all sides, sloping upward,
the forest rippled away into the distance,
solid and green.</p>

<p>Ted descended to the bottom of the basin
and looked closely over the camp site. His
satisfaction was complete as he discovered two
fine springs at a little distance above the spot
where he figured that the tents should go. The
streams from the springs flowed down and into
Bear Creek.</p>

<p>“Two dandy springs,” he reflected. “That’s
fine. The water goes into the creek, and I guess
that makes the water pretty cold, but I suppose
we won’t mind that.”</p>

<p>He continued to look over the spot, noting all
the natural advantages of the place. As far
as he knew there were no disadvantages attached
to it. The ground was carpeted with
soft pine needles and the air was charged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
a fragrant tang. Lost in his thoughts, Ted did
not notice the swift passage of time.</p>

<p>The gloom of the woods increased and he
awoke at last to the lateness of the hour. His
start that afternoon had not been an early one
and he realized that he must hurry back. The
suddenness with which darkness, aided by a
group of dull clouds, came up, amazed him. He
could scarcely see before him as he turned to
leave.</p>

<p>“Golly, it certainly did get dark in a hurry,”
he thought. “I must be getting out of here.
I must be the only one for miles around.”</p>

<p>But a moment later, as he glanced up the
towering mountains to the left of the camp site,
he knew that he was mistaken. In the darkness
above a lantern bobbed and swung.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="fs70">FOLLOWING THE LIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sight of a lantern high up in the mountains
captured Ted’s imagination as well as his
attention. The region seemed to be a particularly
lonely one and he wondered who the lantern-carrier
could be. While there had been
light he had looked along the mountain side
but had seen no house or barn. The wooded
slopes had appeared untouched by the hand of
man and altogether too dense and forsaken for
a house of any kind. Yet the bearer of the
lantern was going somewhere.</p>

<p>The light flashed in and out among the trees
as the bearer carried it onward and upward,
winking at irregular intervals as it passed back
of trees. The gleam was yellow and a trifle
dim, yet there was power enough to it for the
watching boy to see. Although it was perhaps
perfectly natural for someone to walk the mountains
with a lantern, Ted’s mind pondered it.</p>

<p>“Wonder where he can be going? It really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
isn’t any of my business, and I suppose that
the person carrying the lantern knows what he
is up to, but it looks a bit mysterious. Still, it
isn’t necessary to follow it.”</p>

<p>His mind had already considered the possibility
of following, but at first he rejected the
idea wholly. In the first place, the action would
probably end in his seeing the man enter some
hidden barn on perfectly proper business, and
in the second place, it was the right of anyone
to walk along the mountain at any time. But
the upward twist and turn of the tiny, bobbing
light fascinated him.</p>

<p>“I guess I will follow it,” he finally decided.
“I’d like to see where it goes to. I may learn
something about the region if anything can be
learned on a dark night like this, and anyway,
I’ll feel a little more satisfied if I see where
the light is going. Now, let’s see how good I
am at finding my way around here in the dark!”</p>

<p>Centering his eyes upon the light’s feeble
gleam Ted started on his climb up the side
of the mountain. As soon as he plunged into
the trees he lost sight of the gleam which he
was trying to trace, but from time to time he
caught sight of it again as he came out into a
cleared space. It was no longer moving up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
but was keeping on a level of the mountain side
and he took an abrupt cut across the contemplated
line of march. The light moved slower
and slower now and he gained upon it.</p>

<p>In one stretch of his climb Ted lost sight of
the light altogether and for some moments he
was unable to locate it. He was about to give
it up as a bad job when a fleeting flash came
to him through the trees. Now he made out
that the lantern-bearer was standing still and
in this interval he hoped to catch up. With
this in mind Ted rapidly climbed the last slope
and stood on comparatively level ground on
what was a great shoulder of the mountains,
heavily wooded as was the rest of the region.
Before him the lantern, hung in an invisible
hand, cast a circle of light around the ground.</p>

<p>In the shelter of some bushes and trees Ted
crouched and looked at the lantern. It was an
extremely old-fashioned one, with three
rounded sides open and the fourth blank. Due
to this structure of the lamp Ted was unable
to see who it was who held the thing. The
uncompleted circle cast by the lantern showed
only the tips of two large shoes and the shadowy
outline of a pair of trousers which seemed much
the worse for wear. Above this, the bearer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
invisible and might have been looking in Ted’s
direction as well as in any other, for all that the
boy knew. In fact, the continued silence of the
man, combined with his motionlessness, made
Ted somewhat uneasy, for it was possible that
he was simply standing there and looking
around. Ted imagined that he had made a lot
of noise in his climb.</p>

<p>At last the lamp was slightly shifted, much
to Ted’s relief, and he saw at once the object
of the man’s search, or at least the goal of it.
The feeble rays from the old lantern showed
dimly the outline of an old house. In the fitful
gleam there was revealed a short section of the
foundation, which was crumbling away, and a
limited view of the warped boarding on the
side of the house. It was to this spot that the
lone prowler had come and he seemed to be
intent upon his job.</p>

<p>As Ted remained at his post watching the
lantern and the man moved away, passing along
the side of the house. The watcher had a hurried
glimpse of broken masonry and rotting boards
occasionally obscured by masses of bushes and
creepers. The man went around to the back
of the house and for a few moments the light
was entirely withdrawn from Ted’s sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>By this time Ted had entered fully into the
sense of adventure of the thing. Surely, there
was something unusual going on. Something
important must be bringing this man out with
his lantern to look around an old house. The
building itself aroused Ted’s curiosity. Who
could have built it up in the solitary fastness
of the woods and how long had it been standing
idle? Something beside the beauty of the
place must be responsible for the intent prowling
of the man with the lantern.</p>

<p>“I must see this house by daylight,” Ted
decided.</p>

<p>The light winked suddenly around the far
corner of the house and moved along the front.
Rough steps were revealed and the man with
the shadowy legs mounted the steps, crossed the
porch and passed through a gaping doorway
into a front door. A swift glimpse was afforded
Ted of white plaster on the walls and then the
light disappeared.</p>

<p>It was gone for some little time, finally
appearing briefly in an upper window. After
that it disappeared again and was gone so
long that Ted grew highly impatient and
seriously contemplating leaving. He knew that
he should be getting back to the town, for it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
was late and he had a long drive before him.
But the subject in hand fascinated him and he
wanted to see it through.</p>

<p>“I’ll give the gentleman a few more
minutes,” he thought. “If nothing shows up
then, I’ll have to beat it.”</p>

<p>Crouching there in the bushes he waited
straining his eyes toward the blackness of the
house. The whole mountainside had now become
so black that the house was not even distinguishable
as a darker blot, and if the man
with the lantern had not revealed it, Ted could
not possibly have become aware of its presence
except by bumping into it. With the light out
of sight the darkness was a solid wall.</p>

<p>Just as Ted’s impatience was nearing the
breaking point he heard the man with the light
returning. There was a sound of crunching
footsteps and he came down a staircase in the
house and before long the flashing beam of the
lantern showed. Man and lantern crossed the
front porch and without hesitation approached
the bushes off to the left of where Ted was
concealed.</p>

<p>Now the lantern was placed on the ground
and the man, still invisible and keeping out of
the rays of the lamp in a manner that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
particularly irritating, crashed his way into
the bushes. Something was hauled forth with
a rustling, crackling noise. For a brief instant
the sides and rungs of a ladder were disclosed
and then the thing passed out of the light circle.
But there was a bump which led Ted to believe
that the ladder, an old common farm ladder,
had been placed against the side of the house.</p>

<p>In this guess he was correct. The lantern
was lifted from the ground and the two mysterious
legs sought the bottom rung of the
ladder. As Ted watched, the light and the legs
went up step by step, the side of the house,
briefly illuminated, sliding by as the man
mounted to the top.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="fs70">A STARTLING SIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A flash of the lantern showed the slope of
the roof and a broken tin gutter. Plainly the
intention of the man was to mount this roof and
the watching boy wondered how he was going
to do it, as there was a decided slope to the
house covering. But the man with the lantern
evidently knew his territory, for he stepped
from the top of the ladder and his foot descended
to the roof, resting in a hole which the
elements had eaten through the shingles. He
began to climb upward, picking his way along
the top of the roof with a certain foot, knowing
the breaks and the rough spots where he could
travel in safety. Without wavering he pressed
on and reached the top of the house, where a
crooked chimney was shadowily revealed in
the glow of the light. The man raised the
lantern.</p>

<p>Ted peered eagerly from his post in the
bushes, hoping to get a good look at the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
but he was doomed to disappointment, at least
as far as the man’s face was concerned. He
had his back to the boy and only the general
outline was disclosed by his act of raising the
lantern. He was outlined against the sky in
a blurred picture, and he seemed to be tall
and thin. His clothing was of the roughest
sort and his hat was a relic which might, at
one time, have been a soldier’s campaign hat.
The roof seemed to be familiar to the man,
for he proceeded to business as coolly as though
he was standing on the firm ground instead of
on the slope of a rotting roof on a solitary house
in the mountains.</p>

<p>He rested the lantern on the top of the tilted
chimney and then dropped his hands to his
waist, fumbling there for a few moments and
puzzling Ted, who could not make out this
latest move. At length the question was cleared
up, for the man began to pull on something
which revealed itself as a rope and which was
coiled around his waist. In a few minutes it
slipped off of his person and then he proceeded
to tie one end of it to the handle of the lantern.
Then he dropped the lantern down the
mouth of the chimney, paying the rope out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
gradually, his body bent over so that he could
look down the shaft.</p>

<p>Ted was rooted to the spot by the strangeness
of the thing. The light had ceased to shine
abroad, instead, it now shot up a feeble shaft
from the interior of the chimney, bathing the
head and shoulders of the lone man in its
wavering, uncertain gleam. The lower part of
the man’s body was lost to sight and the upper
portion, half disclosed, gave a weird appearance,
as though the man was a half-spirit
materializing in the air. With absorbed attention
the man lowered the lantern until the end
of his rope put an end to the process and then
he began what looked to be a profound search
of the depth of the brick shaft. He moved the
rope from side to side, backward and forward,
the ray of light shifting as he did so, becoming
larger and smaller as the man persisted in
his efforts.</p>

<p>Whether or not his work proved profitable
Ted never knew, for he could not see the face
of the man and there was nothing to be learned
as long as the purpose of the thing was a
mystery. But the man concluded his search in
short order, drawing up the rope rapidly and
pulling out the lantern. Rapidly he untied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
rope, wound it around his waist and then descended
the roof, finding the places where he
dared to walk. His foot found the top rung of
the ladder and he reached the earth a few
seconds later.</p>

<p>The lantern was once more deposited on the
ground. The ladder was removed and placed
in the bushes, and the work of the man seemed
to be finished. He picked up the lantern and
walked off, passing so close to the hiding Ted
that the boy felt the perspiration start suddenly
as he realized that the faltering rays of the
lantern might disclose his hiding place. The
looks of the man were unknown and the prospect
of being seen by a man whose features
were still formless in his mind did not look
inviting to Ted. But the man passed the spot
while he was thinking of these things and
started down the mountain, leaving him to lie
there and wait until it was safe to go on.</p>

<p>It was manifestly not safe to go on just then.
The man was below him and in the darkness
Ted might start a stone down and advertise
his presence, in which case the game would be
very much against him, for the man with the
light knew the country and he was a stranger
in a strange land. He watched the lantern bobbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
down the slope until it was out of sight
and then he sat up, turning the whole thing
over in his mind.</p>

<p>“By George, that surely was a funny one!”
he thought. “What in the world should he go
and lower the lantern down the chimney for?”</p>

<p>The whole circumstance was so unusual that
he was forced to give up the solution as a bad
job and one far beyond his powers to figure
out. The house which the boy had caught brief
glimpses of was apparently a deserted old place
of no value whatsoever and why any one should
take the trouble to search it with a lantern for
was beyond him.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible that there is something
of value in the house?” he wondered, as he
stood up and looked in vain for the light. “I
can’t see why else a man should look around
a place in the night. I wonder why he doesn’t
look around in the daytime? Probably he
would have to have a lantern in the daytime
as well as in the night if he wanted to explore
the bottom of that chimney.”</p>

<p>Ted glanced toward the black outline of the
house, hesitating as a thought entered his mind.
He was debating the question of entering and
looking around the place. In one sense, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
wanted to do so, and in another he did not
want to. The curiosity of the whole thing was
strongly upon him, yet the solitary house was
not inviting. He had no way to make a light
and he knew better than to think of prowling
a dark house, yet he could make an expedition
around the house and get a fair idea of the
place. Then another thought caused him to
abandon that idea.</p>

<p>“There may be some well close to the
house, and I couldn’t afford to fall into it. No,
I guess I’ll be better off to stay out and away
from it. After we have made our camp up here
I’ll go through the house some day.”</p>

<p>Realizing that it was becoming far later than
he had had any idea of, Ted decided to go
back to his little car and drive home. For a
moment he paused, undecided. In his haste to
track the man with the lantern he had not taken
time to map out in his mind the direction in
which he had come and for a moment he was
dismayed at the blackness of the woods. Anyone
used to at least the partial illumination
that exists at all points in a city is apt to be
disagreeably surprised at the total blackness
of the night in the woods, and Ted was experiencing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
this feeling now. But he fought
off his uneasiness.</p>

<p>“I’ll get back to the car,” he told himself.
“I’ve got to! I’ll just follow down the side
of the mountain. Gosh, I never knew how dark
the woods could be!”</p>

<p>He began to descend carefully, feeling his
way before him, covering to the best of his
knowledge the route which he had followed as
he tracked the man with the light. Once or
twice he came out on ledges which ended
abruptly and he was compelled to retrace his
steps and work further down, but before long
he found ground which was more level. In a
few moments he heard the murmur of the
stream and recognized it as that of Bear Creek.</p>

<p>“Landed almost at home!” he exulted. “Now
I guess I can find my way to the Rattletrap!”</p>

<p>He started to cross the long glade which had
been the camp of the Black Riders and came
in sight of the springs. A light flashed there
and he stopped quickly.</p>

<p>Beside one of the springs the lantern rested
on the ground and the figure which had carried
it bent over the spring, washing his hands.
Ted’s foot touched and rolled a stone, which
made a slight noise as it rolled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>The man at the spring bent forward without
looking around and with a single breath blew
the light out.</p>

<p>The situation was an odd one and not at
all a comfortable one. The man with the lantern
was there in the darkness, crouching beside
his darkened instrument, doubtless peering
around him to ascertain who it was who had
approached. Ted stood on the spot where he
had first seen the man at the spring, undecided
as to what to do, his nerves tingling. The one
comforting thought that he had was to the
effect that the man did not know who it was
that had come up behind him and so he felt
a certain reassurance. But if the prowling
man knew from what direction the sounds
of approach came he might take it into
his head to explore in the dark, a thing which
might be very bad for Ted.</p>

<p>In silence they both kept their positions—at
least Ted hoped that the man was keeping his,
and as for the boy he never moved a muscle,
but listened with straining ears. No sound of
a footstep or anything else reached him, the
woods were silent and as far as sound went
Ted might just as well have been in another
world. But he knew that the man was there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
near him and the feeling was not a happy one.</p>

<p>It was always possible for him to call out
and explain his presence there, trusting to luck
that the man before him was no madman and
that his explanation would be accepted on its
face value. But the actions of the man were
so stealthy, so mysterious, that they could not
possibly be honest ones. For any man to bend
forward and blow out a lantern in one, swift
decisive breath was worthy of comment by the
most unsuspicious, and it would be reasonable
to suppose that explanations would not be
accepted by a man engaged in the type of
business that this was employed in.</p>

<p>So he waited for what seemed an age and
when the situation had become almost unbearable
he heard a stone roll and a twig snap
some distance away from the spring, conclusive
proofs that the man with the lantern was stealing
away. Other sounds, accidental but informing,
came to him in the distance which the
man was trying to put between himself and the
boy and Ted felt a sense of relief.</p>

<p>“But he knows that I am here,” he realized.
“He must be up to something so shady that he
doesn’t want to see anyone, no matter who they
may be. Maybe he is one of the fellows who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
gives this camp the reputation of being haunted,
and I don’t wonder that anyone would think
of such a thing if they saw him dodge around
with his lamp. I hope he doesn’t show up and
give the boys a scare, because some of them
are pretty young.”</p>

<p>Guided solely by a sense of direction, Ted
found the path and located his car in the same
spot where he had left it. A rapid inspection
convinced him that the little machine had not
been harmed and he got in, starting his engine
and leaving the spot as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>“I must get home,” he thought. “My folks
will be worrying and I don’t want them to do
that. Tomorrow I must hunt up Buck and tell
him what I saw out there. I think that he will
agree with me that we ought to keep it quiet.”</p>

<p>Ted’s folks were beginning to get worried
but his appearance reassured them and he gave
the excuse that certain things about the camping
spot had interested him so much that he
had remained at the place longer than he had
intended to. Conscious that he had told the
truth and not wishing to alarm them with any
further details, he retired for the night and
enjoyed a good sleep.</p>

<p>On the following day he and Buck attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
the local Young Men’s Bible Class in their
church and on the way back they discussed
the things which Ted had related to his chum
on the way to the church. Buck was unable
to figure anything out and he agreed that they
should make it their own secret.</p>

<p>“We’ll take a look at that old house when
we get camping there,” he said. “Maybe when
we see what it looks like in the daylight we will
be able to tell something. Whatever we do, we
mustn’t allow the boys to know what you saw
and we’ll have to laugh down any silly stories
that are brought up.”</p>

<p>“When the gentleman with the lantern sees
that there is a camp around he’ll probably stay
away,” replied Ted.</p>

<p>“You’re not even going to tell Mr. Calvert,
are you?”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll just tell him that I am impressed
with the camp site itself. No use in spreading
alarm, and it might get out. After all, that
man might have had a good reason to walk
around in the woods at night, and we’d only
look silly making a big story out of it.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Well, I’m all set for the trip. We
start this week, and it can’t come too soon for
me.”</p>

<span class="fs70">SETTING UP CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One morning later in that same week the
two chums arose early and gathered up their
camping outfits. Ted said goodbye to his folks,
swung his pack on his back and sallied forth
to meet Buck, who was standing at his own
gate and waiting for him. Buck was rigged out
in a style similar to Ted’s, with a good camping
pack, a campaign hat, buckskin blouse, stout
trousers, heavy shoes, pick and camp shovel,
and an axe.</p>

<p>“Well, here we go at last!” hailed Buck,
delightedly, eager for the trip before them.
“Seemed like this morning would never come!”</p>

<p>“I was awake a couple of times myself,”
smiled Ted, as they swung along toward the
club house in town. “We have a dandy day for
a start.”</p>

<p>It was a cool morning, bright and clear, and
a more promising day could not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
ordered. Their blood tingled as they looked
forward to the coming encampment.</p>

<p>“Are they going to have one or two trucks?”
Buck asked, as they turned down the street
upon which the club house was located.</p>

<p>“One big one,” Ted replied, “for the fellows,
and a little one for supplies. The tents
and the grub will take up plenty of space and
I guess the number of boys who are going will
fill up the big truck. Eighteen boys have given
their names and with the two of us we’ll have
twenty, a big enough crowd to handle.”</p>

<p>“It surely will be,” murmured Buck. “Especially
if you have never done that sort of thing
before.”</p>

<p>“We won’t have any trouble if we start
right,” said Ted. “If we show the right
authority and set up a sort of military discipline
we’ll get along very well. Most of these
club boys are just small fellows and things
shouldn’t be so difficult with them.”</p>

<p>By this time they had arrived at the club
rooms of the Boys’ Club and there they found
about half of the young boys assembled. Mr.
Calvert was with them and the two trucks
stood at the curb. With interest the two camp
leaders looked the boys over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>They were young boys of the age ranging
between twelve and fifteen and there was one
boy sixteen. They seemed to be a lively bunch
of young fellows who were all obviously keen
for the trip before them. Some of the boys
Ted and Buck knew, either by sight or by name,
but there were several that they did not know.
The boys all had variously assorted packs and
kits with them and while waiting they were
amusing themselves by chattering and tossing
around a large hand medicine ball.</p>

<p>But if the two leaders did not know the boys,
the boys knew them. There was an immediate
rush toward them as they entered the yard
before the frame building which housed the
club. A number of boys plied them with questions.</p>

<p>“You’re really going to be the leader,
Thorny?” a boy asked Ted, who nodded in
smiling assent.</p>

<p>“I am, along with Buck,” he said.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s great!” was the enthusiastic
reply. A stout boy of fourteen pushed up to
Ted, with an anxious look on his face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Thorn, is it true that we won’t have
anything but oatmeal and bread on our camping
trip?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know!” puzzled Ted, looking
toward Mr. Calvert, who winked. “Why do
you ask that?”</p>

<p>“All these fellows been telling me that,”
said the chubby one. “I don’t like just oatmeal
and bread! I guess they’re fooling, eh?”</p>

<p>“I hope so myself,” smiled Ted. “I’d like
something else beside that!”</p>

<p>Mr. Calvert joined the group. “Don’t mind
this boy and his demands for food, Thorn,” he
said. “This is Al Barker, but the boys call
him Drummer.”</p>

<p>“Why? Does he play a drum?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>There was a general laugh and Mr. Calvert
explained. “No but he spends his time between
meals drumming up an appetite for the next
one! So the boys have always called him
Drummer!”</p>

<p>“We’ll try to keep him so well filled that
he won’t have to drum,” grinned Buck, while
the stout boy looked pleased and relieved.</p>

<p>The boys drifted away to various occupations
and the two chums talked over details with Mr.
Calvert. A few more boys had arrived and
the lawyer remarked that they were almost
all on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Are all of the boys of this same age?”
Buck asked.</p>

<p>“All but one of them,” Mr. Calvert said,
lowering his voice. “Or I should say, two of
them, for we have one young boy of eleven and
one boy of seventeen. It is of the older boy
I wish to warn you. His name is Ralph Plum
and he is actually too old for the club boys,
but an uncle of his gave quite a bit of money
toward starting the club and so has always been
allowed to join in with them, though none of the
trustees have felt very cheerful about it. He
is a big hulking fellow and apt to be a trouble
maker, so keep your eyes on him and use your
own judgment. We’re hoping all the time that
he’ll get tired of the club and leave, but so far
he hasn’t, and it was with much regret that
we learned that he was going to go on this
trip. We’ve tried here to teach him something
in the manly line, but haven’t progressed very
far, I’m afraid. Speaking of bad pennies,
there he is now.”</p>

<p>They turned to look at the boy who walked
into the club house yard and were not impressed.
He was as Mr. Calvert had described
him, a huge fellow with wide-spreading
shoulders and a rolling, careless walk. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
camping outfit was brand new and his axe and
knife were of the best. A fine pack was strapped
to his back. But his face was a discontented
one and he chewed gum with an assurance that
was insolent. He passed them easily, nodding
to Mr. Calvert and immediately took the ball
away from the smaller boys and kept it for
some time.</p>

<p>“Something of a bully,” murmured Ted, his
eyes narrowing.</p>

<p>“Quite a bit, I’m sorry to say,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The boys all seemed to be on the ground, Mr.
Calvert said, as he glanced around. “All except
the smallest boy, the eleven-year-old I was
telling you about,” he went on. “Little Tom
Clayton, but I guess he isn’t coming, although
he was eager to come.”</p>

<p>But at that moment the small boy appeared
in company with his father and Mr. Clayton
was introduced to Ted and Buck. He had come
with his boy for a purpose.</p>

<p>“I heard that you two boys were going to
lead the camp,” he told the boys. “It was only
because Mrs. Clayton knew you that she allowed
Tom to go along.” He smiled in a somewhat
nervous manner. “Tom’s our only boy—only
child, in fact, and we set a lot of store by him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
His mother would spoil him by not letting him
go anywhere and certainly never on a trip like
this, but I want Tom to grow up to be a real
man.” He glanced down at his son, a somewhat
pale and sensitive-looking boy, and then went
on: “We had a hard time getting permission
for this camping trip, didn’t we, Tommy? But
we finally made it. I just want to ask you
fellows to see to it that the boy is well taken
care of and that he is properly developed. I
know you will, but I just wanted to make sure
that everything will be all right, you know.”</p>

<p>The two leaders made haste to reassure him.
They could visualize without any trouble the
condition of the boy’s home and they sympathized
with him. The father’s desire to have
the boy grow up to be a fine, strong man was
evident.</p>

<p>All of the boys were now assembled and Mr.
Calvert called for their attention. “I want
you all to file into the club room and sit down
for a last word of instruction from me,” the
president of the club announced, and with more
or less noise they obeyed, pushing and scrambling
to the seats inside the long frame club
house. In the front of them Mr. Calvert and
the two chums stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Now, boys,” the president announced, when
he had obtained their attention. “I simply want
to give you some last minute instructions. Most
of you know that Mr. Thorn and Mr. Dalton will
be in complete charge of the camp to which you
are going, and you are to give them your very
best support in making the camp a good and
effective one. This point I want you to get
clearly in your minds: these two young men are
in absolute charge. Their word is law. If they
do something that you don’t feel is the right
thing to do, you do it anyway, and if you think
it is so bad that you can’t stand it, you write
to me or call me up somewhere before you refuse
to obey orders! We want this camp to be
a credit to the Boys’ Club of this city, and it
can’t be that unless it is an orderly one!”</p>

<p>“You will have a certain amount of camp
work to do, and these leaders will be in charge
of that. Obey them without question. In that
way you will make the most out of your camping
trip and I’m sure that in another year
you’ll want to go again. Any questions, before
you start?”</p>

<p>“This Black Riders’ Camp is said to be
haunted, isn’t it?” Ralph Plumb spoke up,
from where he was lolling around on a bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and the two
boys felt some annoyance. But Ted spoke up.</p>

<p>“There used to be some silly stories about
that,” he smiled. “But they were just old women’s
tales! We’re too sensible to give any
thought to anything like that. If twenty fellows
couldn’t scare away a poor little ghost or witch
or whatever it is they used to say hung around
the place, then we’d better go camping over in
the City Park!”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this and Plum muttered
something, but no attention was paid to him.
There was a scene of confusion as packs were
slung and then the big truck shook as the boys
swarmed over the sides and into it. The smaller
truck with the supplies had already started off.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that Ted would drive the
big truck to the camp and that the driver of the
supply truck would drive it back. The little
truck was the property of the club and would
remain in camp with them, in case they wished
at any time to drive to town for fresh food.
The big truck, which was a hired one, would
go back to the city and return at the end of the
month for the boys.</p>

<p>“Buck, maybe you had better get into the
body of the truck and see to it that none of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
these fellows get to fooling and fall off,” Ted
said, as the boys pushed and jostled in the truck.
“I’d like to have you drive along with me, but
we had better have somebody on duty back
there.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” nodded Buck. “I’d
like to drive alongside of you, but I’ll get back.”
He tossed his pack on board and climbed into
the truck. “All shipshape back here!” he sang
out.</p>

<p>Ted warmed up the engine, shaking hands in
farewell with Mr. Calvert. “Lots of good luck!”
smiled the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Thanks! I’m sure we’ll have a fine time!”</p>

<p>The president leaned nearer. “If there is any
trouble, Thorn, let me know at once.”</p>

<p>“I will,” Ted nodded, “but I’m sure everything
will be fine. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>The truck rumbled off in a cloud of dust and
gasoline smoke, the boys gave a shrill cheer,
and the journey to Black Riders’ Camp had
begun.</p>

<p>The ride was a long one in the truck but the
boys did not mind it. In the back of the truck
the boys talked and sang and Buck joined them
in their conversation, answering a number of
questions concerning camping life in general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Outside the last town on their route they met
the supply truck waiting and in company they
proceeded down the bumpy wood road until the
autos could go no farther. They were in the
shelter of the trees and a stone’s throw from
the camp of the Black Riders.</p>

<p>“All out and grab some equipment!” shouted
Buck, and they descended from the truck in a
torrent, making shrill demands for their packs
from those who were still in the truck. These
were supplied and then Ted and Buck ordered
them to unload the supply truck. This was
soon done and the boys began to descend the
slope to the camping spot.</p>

<p>The driver of the supply truck took the big
truck back to the city, leaving the smaller vehicle
alone there in the woods. Ted then made
his way to the camping grounds and heard with
pleasure the cries of delight as the boys looked
over the spot.</p>

<p>“It surely is a dandy,” Buck told him.
“Well, I suppose we had better step to it and
get the tents up.”</p>

<p>To this work they fell with a will and before
long four big brown tents had been pegged down
tightly. They were on a slight slope facing the
creek, with the springs off to one side and back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
of them. By the time the canvas shelters were
up it was growing dusk and Buck and a squad
made haste to gather a big load of wood for
night. Others, under Ted’s leadership, built a
fine, substantial fireplace. By the time that this
was done the darkness had settled over them
like a blanket, and the new fires tossed a yellow
and flickering light to the sky.</p>

<p>“This will be our first night out here,” Ted
reflected, as he looked around him. “Wonder
what it will be like?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs70">A PROWLER IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>An event for which the boys had long been
waiting now came, after some confusion, to
pass. Several requests had been made for
something to eat but Ted turned a deaf ear to
it until the camp had been put in shape. The
noon meal had been a sandwich affair and now
the hungry stomachs were demanding something
solid. Ted gave orders for the meal.</p>

<p>He and Buck took care of the cooking for
that one meal and they had a big job on their
hands. The two fires were used to cook beans
and soup and warm up coffee and before long
the fragrant smell of the food floated through
the woods around them. Impatiently the boys
awaited their meal.</p>

<p>“Seems like I never was so hungry before!”
sighed Drummer, gazing at the big pot of cooking
beans with wistful eyes.</p>

<p>“You drummed up a good appetite this afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
didn’t you?” someone asked, and the
stout boy nodded.</p>

<p>They used a flat stump to cut the bread on
and for a general table, finding that its location
to the fires made it a handy natural object.
Buck organized a number of the boys to
go and bring pails of water so that they could
be put on the fire as soon as the food was off,
to heat for dish water.</p>

<p>“Do we have to wash dishes here?” was an
innocent inquiry.</p>

<p>“Well, I want mine washed,” grinned Buck.
“If you want to eat from yours without washing,
why, go right ahead!”</p>

<p>“Who is going to wash them, Mr. Dalton?”
a boy asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a volunteer gang tonight,” responded
Buck, seeing to it that each boy had
a pail. “After that, we’ll have regular squads
to do the work. Go to it, boys.”</p>

<p>Ted had found that the supply truck was
well filled and figuring even recklessly he was
of the opinion that they would not soon have to
renew their main supplies, though things such
as butter and eggs and milk would have to be
taken care of from day to day. Much care and
thought had been taken by the leaders of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
Boys’ Club in the selection of the goods, and
Ted was pleased.</p>

<p>At length the supper was cooked, the beans
lifted from the fire and the coffee pushed back
to keep warm. “Come and get it!” called
Buck, and they obeyed loyally and enthusiastically.
Forming in a line they pushed their cups
and plates toward Buck and Ted and for some
minutes the two leaders were busy dishing and
pouring. Within the circle of the fires the boys
sat around, most of them silent as they applied
themselves to the subject at hand.</p>

<p>“Golly, nothing ever seemed so good at
home!” declared Drummer, munching contentedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so much of beans,” struck in
Ralph Plum. “I wouldn’t eat ’em home!”</p>

<p>“You aren’t home,” was Drummer’s retort.
“What do you eat them here for?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything else, is there?” retorted
Plum.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” replied Drummer. “Any time
you don’t want your beans you just let me know,
Ralph.”</p>

<p>The little fellow, Tom Clayton, sat close beside
Ted as they ate and Ted smiled down into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
his serious face. “How are you enjoying it,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Great!” was the answer. “I’m glad I could
come along, Mr. Thorn!”</p>

<p>“So am I,” agreed Ted. “We’ll have a lot
of fun out of this camping trip. You won’t
get homesick, will you?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” was the slow answer.
“I’ve only been away from home once before
this, but I guess I won’t be homesick. Anyway,
if I do, I won’t let these fellows see it, because
they’ll kid me about it!”</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit!” approved Buck.</p>

<p>After the meal was over came the task which
was not welcomed any too cheerfully. A multitude
of greasy tin plates and cups lay piled up
near the creek and the pails of water were
ready. Ted asked for volunteers, and a few
of the boys helped the two leaders do the washing
and drying. Most of the boys were content
to lie around and chatter. When the camp work
was finished they all gathered around the fires
while Ted addressed them.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows,” he began, when he had
claimed their attention. “Tonight is rather an
informal time and we’re just getting acquainted.
Tomorrow we’ll settle down to real business.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Up to now I don’t even know the names
of all of you, but I’ll get on to them pretty
quickly. In order to get the best results out of
our encampment we’ll have to have good discipline
and willing workers. For instance, we’ll
have to have a wood-gathering committee, a
fire committee, a cooking committee, a water
committee, and a dishwashing committee. Some
of these committees won’t be as popular as
others, I know, but we won’t be on the same
committees all of the time. Frequent changes
will give us all a chance to work at something
different. Buck and I will take our share of
the work along with the rest of you.”</p>

<p>“That makes me think of something else.
Some of you are calling me Mr. Thorn and calling
Buck, Mr. Dalton. That’s very nice, but we
want to be all fellows here together and so we
are just plain Ted and Buck to you. We’ll all
work together and have a good time. Now
about the tents: we have four of them and that
means that there will be five in a tent. We have
plenty of room, and Buck will sleep in one of
the tents and I in another. For the other two
tents I’ll appoint a captain and he is to be in
complete charge of that tent. To him you will
make any complaint or suggestion and he can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
take it up with me. We’ll want to go to bed
early at night so that we’ll get plenty of good
sleep. We’ll be up early in the mornings.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t we put the tents up in between
the trees?” a boy asked.</p>

<p>“Because there will be such things while we
are here as thunder storms,” smiled Ted. “And
if we do have them we want to be out in the
open and not under a tree which might be struck
by lightning and fall over!”</p>

<p>This was a thought which had not as yet
struck any of them and for a moment there was
complete silence. They were all young boys
and the woods experience was new to them.
Thunder storms had been witnessed by most of
them from a secure house or a comfortable bed
and the thought that they would now be almost
exposed to the elements was somewhat staggering.
They looked around and up into the blackness
of the crouching mountains.</p>

<p>“Gee, it does get some dark up here, doesn’t
it?” inquired one boy, in an awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>The circle of light from the fires was not a
large one and the blackness around them seemed
an immensity which held untold things mysteriously
unpleasant. Buck laughed to reassure
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, they don’t have any street lights up
here,” he said. “The animals like dark nights!”</p>

<p>“Animals!” cried another boy. “Are there
any animals up here? Do they call the water
Bear Creek on purpose!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ted. “Some day we’ll
look up the animals and see if any of them live
around here.”</p>

<p>The talk was resumed and under cover of it
Buck and Ted conferred. “You think I had better
sleep in another tent than the one you are
going to have?” Buck asked.</p>

<p>“I think so,” nodded Ted. “You take the
one on that end and I’ll take the one at this end.
We’ll put the smaller fellows in the two middle
tents and that will reassure them a little
more.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they are going to be scared?”</p>

<p>“No, not when they get used to the camp, but
you see they didn’t have much in the way of
daylight today while here and the night seems
so black. Probably a lot of them won’t sleep
and it will seem an age before the sun comes up
tomorrow.” He glanced at his watch. “I guess
we had better turn in now.”</p>

<p>The word to this effect was passed around
and the boys were not reluctant to turn in. Ted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
told off Bob Gilmore as the captain of one tent
and Charlie Wells as leader of the other one.</p>

<p>“Each one of you will undress by the light of
a single lantern which will be hung from the
pole of the tent,” he directed. “As soon as the
last man is in bed the captain of that tent will
personally put out the light. No loud talking
after you are in your beds, in fact, none at all
would be better, because you’ll keep somebody
else awake. Now go to it.”</p>

<p>The fires burned low and the four tents glowed
with a subdued light as the boys all prepared
for bed. In the tent with Ted was little Tom
Clayton and three other fine young fellows and
they were speedily in their beds which they had
built from boughs and packed leaves. Ted had
purposely placed the bed of the small boy beside
his own. They were all in under their blankets
when he put out the light and crawled in
between his own.</p>

<p>The talking in the other tents died down as
the lights were extinguished. That some of the
boys were restless was attested to by the rustling
turnings in their beds. One boy had gathered
his boughs with too much wood attached
to the smaller branches and they made him so
uneasy and uncomfortable that he was compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to throw most of it out and sleep closer to
the canvas covering that served as a tent floor.
Some deep breathing announced that a few boys
had fallen instantly asleep, tired out with the
events of the day.</p>

<p>There was no talking on the part of the boys
in Ted’s tent, inspired probably by his presence
and the little boy at least did not remain awake
long. Ted’s eyes began to close and the last
sounds and impressions were somewhat dim.
The fire snapped once or twice, the wind blew
with a very faint rustle of leaves, and a katydid
started his endless fiddling, being joined by several
others who tried to out-fiddle him. Then
Ted went to sleep.</p>

<p>He slept on for what seemed to be some hours
and then a light struck quickly and fleetingly
across his eyes. The flap of the tent was half
open and he could look out, but there was no
repetition of the incident. He was puzzled and
sat up.</p>

<p>“Was that from the fires?” he wondered,
poking his head out of the tent and glancing towards
the two fireplaces.</p>

<p>It was not. Both fires had gone out and not
a single spark glowed to show even where they
had been. But there was no question in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
mind as to whether there had been a light, for
the thing had been very definite. He stepped
out of the tent, unmindful of the cool, damp
earth under his bare feet, and stood there in his
pajamas, looking keenly around.</p>

<p>A wandering beam of light came from around
the last tent, the tent in which Buck was sleeping,
and Ted frowned. “Now, who the dickens
can be prowling around with a lantern?” he
wondered, starting forward. “I’m going to
find out.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs70">WEIRD SOUNDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The faint shaft of light vanished as Ted made
his way along the line of the silent tents and for
a moment he almost doubted that he had seen it.
His total glimpses had consisted of flashes and
nothing more, and the fact spurred him on with
greater curiosity. When he had first seen the
light he thought it might have been one of the
boys or even Buck prowling around, but the way
the gleams came and went he began to doubt
it seriously. Remembering the man whom he
had previously seen, he became cautious as he
stepped to the end of Buck’s tent and looked
around.</p>

<p>He was not able to see a thing, for the darkness
was so dense that it presented to him only
a solid wall. His ears were listening keenly but
he heard nothing. He supposed he had better
look back of the tents, but this thought brought
a problem. There was no use in doing that unless
he took a lantern with him, and he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
alarm the boys if he did so. The question was
not an agreeable one.</p>

<p>A low hiss reached his ears, a sound which
came from the tent. He thrust his head inside
the flap.</p>

<p>“That you, Buck?”</p>

<p>An answering whisper came back to him.
“Yes. What are you doing up?”</p>

<p>“I’m just looking around, that is all. Can’t
you sleep?”</p>

<p>“I was sleeping until you flashed your light
in here! What are you looking for?”</p>

<p>“Come on outside a minute,” directed Ted,
still in the same low whisper. Buck made motions
which led his chum to think that he was
tossing aside his blanket and then he joined him
outside of the tent, grunting as his feet touched
the cool earth.</p>

<p>“Gosh, this ground is cold! What in the
world are you—”</p>

<p>“Buck, did you see a light before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when you passed by with the lantern.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the point—I didn’t pass by with
any lantern! I was awakened by a flash in my
eyes and then as I looked out of the tent flap I
saw the light dodge down this way. Somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
who doesn’t belong to the camp is prowling!”</p>

<p>Buck was impressed at once. “But we don’t
know if everybody is in their tents,” he pointed
out.</p>

<p>“They are all in my tent and I suppose they
are all in yours, but we don’t know about the
others. The worst part of it all is that we can’t
go snooping into the tents to see, because if we
wake the youngsters up we’ll throw a scare
into them. I guess we’ll have to do all the investigating
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a flashlight inside and I think I can
locate it,” whispered Buck. “Hope I don’t
wake anybody up!”</p>

<p>He felt his way into the blackness of the tent
and located the flashlight, appearing with it immediately
afterward. “All right, let’s go,” he
whispered. “I don’t like this barefoot business
though.”</p>

<p>“Best we can do. Keep your light shaded
away from the tents.”</p>

<p>Buck carefully switched the light on, keeping
the glare of it away from the tent, playing the
beam on the undergrowth in back of the tent.
Nothing out of the ordinary was disclosed to
their view and they walked with tense muscles
around in the back of the shelters. Here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
light was played around the bushes and trees
but everything around the camp was normal.
In silence they moved away and even went as
far as the springs, but their trip was in vain
and their only reward wet and cold feet.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” shrugged Buck, turning off
the light.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that you saw the light, though,”
said Ted. “I would have begun to think that
I was seeing things. Well, I don’t know what
we had better do.”</p>

<p>“The only thing that we can do is to go to
bed and sleep as lightly as possible,” returned
Buck. “We are on the ends and if anyone
comes into the camp we should hear ’em. Funny
thing, though, we didn’t hear anything out of
that prowler after he put his light out. Confound
it, looks like somebody was trying to
make this a haunted camp!”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t let the boys know anything
about it. Suppose we get to bed and keep our
ears open as much as we can.”</p>

<p>They parted, each to return to his own tent,
and in his Ted carefully eased himself into his
bed listening intently. There were no sounds
abroad, however, and for a long time he managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
to keep awake but at last the effort was
too much for him and he went to sleep.</p>

<p>Morning came without incident and early the
whole camp was astir. The day was a fine and
clear one, a little warm but not too much so.
Some of the hardier souls went for their initial
swim in Bear Creek but to most of the boys the
black waters looked too cool. Ted and Buck
were among those who went in, and Ted, after
probing for depth with a pole, was perfectly
satisfied that it was deep enough at one point
to dive in. He led the way in a splendid dive.</p>

<p>The water struck a sharp shock through him
and by its very coldness he knew that springs
surely fed the brook somewhere. But he showed
no sign of his shock when he bobbed to the
top, shaking his head and clearing his eyes.</p>

<p>“How is it?” Buck cried, from his post on
the bank.</p>

<p>“Fine!” replied Ted. “Warm as toast!”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t feel like any toast I ever had to my
feet,” Buck replied, poising for his dive. “But
I guess it is all right when you get in. Here
goes!”</p>

<p>He flashed downward in a fine dive and when
he appeared on the surface of the water he
looked at the grinning Ted. “Wow! what nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
cold water!” he shouted. “This may be Bear
Creek, and I’ll say it is a bear! Warm as toast,
eh?”</p>

<p>After the invigorating swim they dressed and
the task of preparing breakfast was undertaken.
The effects of the camping trip were beginning
to tell, for all the boys had developed
hearty appetites and looked in a fair way to
sinking the provision pile alarmingly.</p>

<p>Ted and Buck managed to take a quick look
back of the tents but there was no trace of the
night visitor. They were inclined to think that
it was merely some neighboring farmer, though
they confessed that his zeal must have been
great to have brought him in curiosity to that
spot at such a time.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, nobody knows about it,” Buck
said, but he was mistaken. Plum spoke up as
they were eating breakfast.</p>

<p>“Who was going around with a lantern last
night?” he asked. There was a general stir of
interest.</p>

<p>“Who says anybody was?” Buck asked,
coolly.</p>

<p>“I saw it,” was the confident assertion. “I
slept in your tent and you went out and talked
to Ted, only I couldn’t make out what you said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Then you two went for a walk around the
tents.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t do much sleeping, did you?” inquired
Buck.</p>

<p>“No. But how about the light? Was somebody
walking around the camp last night?”</p>

<p>Ted and Buck exchanged glances. They were
annoyed that Plum had brought up the subject
but they saw that he was not to be denied. Ted
took it upon himself to answer.</p>

<p>“We think somebody did pass the tents,” he
was forced to admit. “Perhaps it was some
farmer who took a shortcut or something, because
we didn’t find him. That is all there was
to it.”</p>

<p>But Plum had ideas of his own. “But you
two were worried, weren’t you?” he pressed.
“I heard you talking and then Buck got his
flashlight and you went exploring. How about
it?”</p>

<p>“Do we look very much worried over anything?”
Buck grinned, secretly angry with the
insistent one.</p>

<p>“You were last night,” said Plum doggedly.</p>

<p>They turned the conversation and the meal
was soon over, but the boys talked of the unknown
prowler more than Ted and Buck cared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to have them talk. There was one good remedy
for their fears, however, and that was tried.
Hard work soon made them forget about the
previous night. Squads were told off and the
labors of the day were begun. A group spent
a few hours cutting and piling fire wood and
others washed the dishes. One group under
Buck went to work in deadly earnest on the
tents. The bedding was all strung on lines to
air and the boys were taught that cleanliness is
as important in camping life as in private life.
The beds were all more carefully remade and
then ditches were dug around the tents so that
the water from a rain storm would run away
from the tents and not come in over the canvas
floors. All these tasks took up most of the day
and late in the afternoon all of them went swimming.</p>

<p>The two leaders found that few of the boys
could swim well and some could not swim a
stroke, so they organized a swimming class at
once and the next two hours were spent in giving
instructions. Some of the boys were timid
and clearly afraid of the cold water, but Buck
and Ted patiently taught them, stressing the
value of a thorough knowledge of swimming.
The small boy was very much afraid and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
shivered pronouncedly, but he kept his lips
tightly closed and made a valiant effort at it.</p>

<p>In this way another day wore to its close and
while they were eating supper the darkness
folded down over the camp. But by this time
they had become used to the “feel” of camp life
and the location became somewhat familiar to
them. Now that the hardest part of pitching
the camp was attended to they began to plan
more than one tramp through the mountains
which encircled them.</p>

<p>When the dishes were piled away they sat
around the fire, enchanted by the red magic
which emanates from glowing embers and the
darkness closed in more tightly. There were no
stars on this night and there was even a little
oppressiveness in the air, as though it was
charged with something not altogether pleasant.
Not wishing the boys to dwell on subjects
which would worry them Ted and Buck kept the
conversation going rapidly and they talked of
football and baseball, camping and canoeing.</p>

<p>But Plum was the trouble maker. His mind
reverted to things which the leaders wished to
avoid. His eyes roved around the dark camp.</p>

<p>“This camp could easily be haunted,” he remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
patting an instant stop to the cheerful
conversation.</p>

<p>“Who believes in ghosts anyway?” snorted
Drummer.</p>

<p>“Nobody with any sense,” retorted Plum.
“But just think of this place in the old days,
when the Black Riders were meeting here to
plan out raids on the British. There must be
something scary about a place like this.”</p>

<p>“Never mind any such talk about foolish
things, Plum,” called Ted, sharply. “This is
a fine place and everything around is as it
should be.”</p>

<p>Hard on the heels of this statement there
came a sound which made the faces of the boys,
old and young, blanch with fear. A wild, dismal
howl rose on the air, seemingly overhead,
and echoed in a sobbing wail as it was tossed to
the mountains. The silence which succeeded
was almost as bad as the shuddering shriek.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs70">A GRIM FIND EXPLODED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The silence lasted for what seemed to be a
long moment and then Buck and Ted sprang to
their feet. A dozen tongues were unloosed and
an exciting chorus went up, in which uneasiness
prevailed.</p>

<p>“What in the world could that have been?”
Buck asked Ted, as they peered into the darkness
beside the camp, in the direction from
which the sound had seemed to come.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me,” was the perplexed answer.
“I never heard anything like it before in my
life. Let’s get the lanterns and go look
around.”</p>

<p>They went to the tents to get the lanterns and
Bob and Charlie got out the ones in the middle
tents and lighted them. The boys were now
standing in a huddle around the fireplace and
talking.</p>

<p>“I knew that this was no place for us,” Plum
was telling the other boys. “I always heard that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
this camp was haunted. I guess I’m going
home.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we had all better go home,” suggested
another boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, go home and let the whole town have
the laugh on us!” snorted Drummer.</p>

<p>The four lanterns were lighted but before
they sallied forth another sound reached their
ears. It was that of an object which had apparently
just fallen, for they could hear it strike
the rocks and break. This came from the same
direction as the weird call had come and for an
instant they simply stood and looked in the direction,
waiting for some further sign. But the
silence was unbroken.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go,” said Ted, starting off
towards the woods with his lantern. “We’ll
see if we can learn anything.”</p>

<p>He and Buck took the lead, the two smaller
boys bringing up cautiously in the rear, fearful
but curious. The two older boys plunged
straight into the bushes that fringed the camp
and mounted the slopes of the mountain, looking
before them as they went, on the alert for
something unusual. There was no further sound
and they proceeded to the spot from which the
sound had come, to find it a high and bare rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
which commanded an excellent view of their
camp.</p>

<p>“Somebody stood here and looked down at
the camp,” said Buck, with conviction.</p>

<p>“You’re right about that,” nodded Ted. “I
think they must have dropped something at the
bottom of this big rock. Let’s go and see.”</p>

<p>“Here come the rest of the boys,” said Bob.</p>

<p>The others had become tired of standing
around the fires and now, as their courage began
to return, they climbed the short slope and
joined the boys with the lanterns. The lightbearers
had made their way down to the base
of the rock and there they flashed the light
around, resulting in an instant discovery. On
a smaller rock lay some fragments of a sea
shell, now broken into several sections.</p>

<p>“Just an old sea shell!” cried Drummer.
“What good is that?”</p>

<p>“Do you know what it is?” Ted asked Buck.</p>

<p>“Can’t say that I do,” he shook his head.</p>

<p>Ted picked up the fragments, fitting them together
until the large shell was nearly whole.
“This is a conch shell,” he said. “It is often
used as a horn, and when it was blown it makes
plenty of noise, as we just found out! This is
the horn which was blown to scare us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“That’s a seashore shell, isn’t it?” Plum
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, a large marine shell, a univalve shell,
and it can be blown into and makes quite a good
horn. Somebody from up on top of that rock
saw us down in the camp and just tooted that
shell to scare us.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they use those shells a lot in the Revolutionary
war, to call people?” a boy asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and this may be one as old as that.
Some farmer around here must have owned it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet anything that those Black Riders
had shells like that and maybe all that stuff
about the camp being haunted is true,” argued
Plum. “It sort of seems as though a spirit of
one of those fellows is trying to warn us away!”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in ghosts, Plum?” Ted asked,
looking straight into the eyes of the big boy.</p>

<p>“Well, no, but——”</p>

<p>“If this was a ghost he was a pretty careless
one wasn’t he? Couldn’t even hold on to his
conch. I guess we don’t have to worry about
anyone as careless as that.”</p>

<p>Plum muttered but no further attention was
paid to him. They hunted all around the rock
and even went a short distance into the surrounding
woods, but not a single clue was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
found. The woods were dark and silent, breathing
an air of mystery.</p>

<p>Ted ordered them back to the camp and to
bed. There was a bit of protest at this, but Ted
put it down at once.</p>

<p>“There is no need to sit up and talk about it
all,” he told them. “It is already past the hour
for retiring anyway, and you need sleep, because
some of you didn’t sleep any too well last
night. I guess everything is over and you’ll
have nothing to worry about.”</p>

<p>“You guess!” grumbled Plum, expressively.</p>

<p>Ted looked at him sternly. “We’re not going
to sit up like a bunch of frightened old maids
looking for something to happen,” he said. “Into
your tents, now!”</p>

<p>There was much chattering as the boys reluctantly
obeyed this order. Buck and Ted met
for a final word.</p>

<p>“Looks as though somebody didn’t want us
around here,” Buck said.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that is the whole point,” nodded
Ted, speaking in a low tone. “But we have
every right to be here and no one is going to
make us go. The bad part about this whole
thing is that we can’t ask any of these little fellows
to stand guard at night. They’d fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
asleep and be scared to death in the bargain.
Neither can you and I do all the watching, so
we’ll have to just trust to luck and be on the
lookout.”</p>

<p>But the balance of that night passed quietly
away. The two leaders tried to sleep lightly
and some of the boys slept fitfully and fearfully,
but there was nothing to disturb them and
when the morning came the events of the night
did not seem so black as they had seemed at the
time.</p>

<p>After camp chores had been completed the
two older boys and a small squad set out to
make a thorough search of the immediate
neighborhood, but nothing was found although
their search was an exhausting one. It was
finally given up as a bad job and the afternoon
was devoted to swimming. That evening and
night were undisturbed and for the first time
since they had struck camp everyone got a good
and satisfactory sleep.</p>

<p>On the following day they took a hike, leaving
a reserve force back at the camp under Buck.
Between themselves they had agreed that one of
them was to stay in camp if the other was out
of it, and Ted felt safer knowing that the camp
was well protected. They made a long trip of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
it, climbing the mountains, finding a deep valley
and a cave and when it was growing late in the
afternoon they came back, tired but satisfied.
Ted had purposely led them around by the old
house where he had first watched the man with
the lantern and as soon as the boys saw the
place they wanted to explore it.</p>

<p>Nothing suited Ted better and they roamed
all over the house, finding it of great interest.
It had evidently been furnished at the time of
its abandonment, for there were beds and bureaus,
tables, chairs and a sofa in the house, all
the worse for the wear and tear of the elements
which had found unobstructed entrance through
doors and broken windows. It was not a farm
house, for there was no barn near it and it appeared
to be more on the style of a private
house. On one corner, just above the front
porch, there was an octagon tower or cupola
and they entered that from the front bedroom,
obtaining from its glassless windows a fairly
good view off across the mountains. Whoever
had lived in the place had left it fully furnished
and the storms of a few years and one or two
visiting and curious persons, possibly small
boys, had made a wreck out of the glassware
and the furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Ted looked around carefully to see if there
was any clue as to why the man with the lantern
should have lowered the thing into the chimney
but he could learn nothing definite. There were
several open fireplaces in the house and he could
see no reason why anyone should want to lower
a lantern to them. When they finally left the
place he had obtained a working knowledge of
it but was none the wiser as to the intentions of
the mountain prowler.</p>

<p>The others were preparing the fires for supper
when they returned and everyone helped in
the process of getting the evening meal. Buck
and the camp squad planned a hike on the following
day while the others took their turn at
guarding the camp.</p>

<p>Once more the night passed without incident
and they were beginning to feel reassured. If
someone did not desire their presence they had
undoubtedly tired of the attempt to oust them
and they were now able to enjoy the camping
trip unmolested.</p>

<p>Buck’s squad went for their hike on the following
day and came in late in the afternoon.
They had taken an entirely different direction
and they had but one incident of importance to
report. In a sheltered valley about a mile away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
they had come upon something that excited
their curiosity.</p>

<p>“It was a good sized log cabin,” Drummer
related. “There was a high barbed wire fence
around it! Can you imagine a log cabin way out
in the woods with a barbed wire fence around
it?”</p>

<p>“Anyone living in it?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so, at least it looked as though
somebody was. A couple of windows were open
and a curtain was flapping out in the breeze.
The gate on the fence was padlocked. Whoever
lives way out there doesn’t want any company.”</p>

<p>“It surely is a queer looking place,” Buck
said, thoughtfully “Right in the midst of wild
country, too. There is a little cabin that looks
like a stable in the back of the place, and a
steamer chair was out in front. We went
up and looked in but nobody came out, though
if there was anybody at home they must have
heard us talking.”</p>

<p>“Funny that anyone should want to put up
a fence like that out in the mountains,” Ted
thought. “And with curtains and a steamer
chair in evidence, it doesn’t look as though it
was some wild mountaineer. I’d like to know
who it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe someone around here knows about
the place,” suggested Buck. “When we go for
eggs and butter we’ll find out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we will have to go tomorrow,” nodded
Ted. “By the way, we must build a good
ice box. I think we can sink one in the mud
down near the creek.”</p>

<p>They were on their way to the tents that night
to turn in, when an odd sound reached their
ears, causing them to look toward the back section
of their camp beyond the tents. The wind
had been blowing in gusts for the last hour and
there had been a distinct rustling in the trees
and bushes. But this was something different,
a rattle and a click, and it came from a section
which they had never bothered to investigate
with any degree of interest, though it is probable
that one or two of them had been to the
spot. They stood outside the tent and listened,
and as a gust of wind sighed through the trees
the clicking came again.</p>

<p>“What can that be?” Buck asked.</p>

<p>Ted reached into the tent and took down the
lantern. “We’ll soon see,” he said. But one
of the younger boys was ahead of him. Bob
Gilmore, the captain of the tent next to Buck’s,
took the lantern from his tent and taking a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
cut between the tents, plunged into the undergrowth.
The light winked at them for a moment
and then was gone.</p>

<p>The others followed Buck, Ted, and Charlie
Wells in a body as they hurried on after Bob.
Then, right in front of them they heard a smothered
gasp and a crashing. Bob burst through
the bushes, lantern in shaking hand, his face
white as a sheet.</p>

<p>“A skeleton!” he gasped, staring at them
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“A what?” cried Buck, sharply.</p>

<p>“A skeleton,” the boy repeated. “Hanging
on a tree and the bones are clicking together.
Listen!”</p>

<p>The wind sighed, and the clicking noise reached
them, blanching the faces of the boys. Ted
started forward, and in an open space he came
upon a sight calculated to unnerve anyone not
gifted with feelings of iron. A skeleton hung
from an old rope, swaying in the breeze, the
skull lying on the ground upside down. In the
dark glade, lighted only by their lanterns, the
sight was indeed a creepy and chilling one.</p>

<p>The other boys came crowding in, huddling in
a group, scared but fascinated, while Ted picked
up the skull and examined it. Then he moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
all around the hanging bones, the lantern flashes
stabbing through the ribs. When he turned to
the others they were amazed to find that he was
smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“What is the joke?” Buck asked, blankly.</p>

<p>“Why, this poor skeleton must feel pretty
much out of place here in the woods,” was
Ted’s reply. “He belongs in, and must recently
have come from a doctor’s office!”</p>

<span class="fs70">TED LAYS DOWN THE LAW</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“How do you know that?” Buck asked, as
they all crowded closer to look at the dangling
skeleton.</p>

<p>“Because the person who hung it here forgot
to notice that there is a name on the lower left
rib,” replied Ted, pointing. “There is some
white chalk over it, but if you look closely you’ll
see the name of Doctor Hemple. I don’t know
anything about skeletons, but this one has evidently
been in this state a long time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged!” cried Buck. “What do you
suppose anyone did that for?”</p>

<p>“I imagine that it is all part of what has been
going on right along,” Ted answered. “Somebody
thought this would scare us. But I guess
they thought we haven’t any eyes or brains!
Look at the rope which is holding it up! It is
an old one, and somewhat weather-beaten, but
not as much as it would be if this was the skeleton
of a man who had either hung himself or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
been hanged in the woods. I wouldn’t be a bit
surprised if whoever hung it here wanted us to
believe that it was the skeleton of some British
soldier!”</p>

<p>“Looks like somebody is trying to impress
us with the history of the place,” smiled Buck.</p>

<p>“Looks more to me as though someone was
trying to impress us with the fact that we aren’t
welcome around here,” grumbled Ted. “But
this act won’t get them anywhere. If that rope
was supposed to have hung there all these years
while the skin dropped off and all trace of the
clothing disappeared, all I have to say is that
it is a mighty fine piece of rope, that is all!”</p>

<p>“It certainly was well thought out otherwise,”
remarked Buck, as the boys fell to talking
it over among themselves. “The head lying
on the ground half upside down looks for all
the world as though the skull fell off and has
never been touched.”</p>

<p>“That skull has been touched, though,” said
Ted, examining it. “It has been cut with some
surgical tool. Well, that was just a lot of time
wasted on the part of someone.”</p>

<p>“But it is a real skeleton, isn’t it, Ted?”
Drummer asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it is real enough, all right, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
belongs in some doctor’s study and has been
there for a long time. I never heard of a Doctor
Hemple, but we’ll try and find out if there is
anyone around here with that name.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it?” Buck
asked. Ted considered, but shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know. We don’t want it, and
at the same time we don’t want it hanging
around here to click with the wind. Let’s put
it up in the hollow above and leave it there.
We can look at it from time to time and see
if anyone has taken it.”</p>

<p>The boys shrank from touching the thing so
Ted and Buck cut the rope down, picked up
the skull, and carried the skeleton to a small
hollow well above the camp, where they left
it and returned to the others.</p>

<p>“That skeleton was rather a clever fellow,”
laughed Ted. “We found that his joints had
all been wired together with a thin wire, which
means that after his skin dropped off he got
down off of his rope, wired himself together,
and then got back on his rope, if we’re supposed
to think it is a genuine affair. I think
that whoever hung it there must have hoped
that we’d be so scared that we would flee from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
the camp in terror, without stopping to investigate
thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“Say, this couldn’t be a trick to draw us out
of camp, could it?” Buck asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence as they
thought it over. Ted seized his lantern.</p>

<p>“I hope not, but it might be,” he cried, bolting
through the bushes.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to worry about on that
score. The camp was perfectly peaceful and
if anyone had visited it in their absence there
was no trace of the fact. The fires were dying
and everything was in order.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s get to bed, and we’ll talk
about it all in the morning,” Ted called, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Most of the boys obeyed at once, but four or
five boys clustered around Ralph Plum, who
was talking to them earnestly. Their heads
were close together and he seemed to be doing
all the talking. Ted walked over to them and
they looked at him somewhat nervously.</p>

<p>“Well, what is on your minds?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>The other boys looked at Plum and he cleared
his throat defiantly. As he stood before Ted
he was fully as big as the leader, with a bigger
shoulder spread. Obviously he was out of place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
with the smaller boys and should have been
one of the leaders, a fact that had crossed his
mind more than once as he secretly chaffed
under Ted’s and Buck’s orders. He was well
aware that his relative had given a big sum of
money to the organization, and to rank simply
as a member of the club and not even as a captain
of a tent had irritated him from the start.
Deep in his heart there was a fear of the camp
they were in, and although he would not go so
far as to say that he feared the presence of anything
supernatural near the place, he did feel
a bad atmosphere and it made him perpetually
uneasy.</p>

<p>“We fellows don’t like this place for a camping
place,” he began. “We want to go somewhere
else.”</p>

<p>“Want to run away, eh!” asked Ted, as the
other boys, crowding into the open, watched.</p>

<p>“We aren’t running away,” returned Plum,
doggedly. “But this place isn’t healthy for
anybody. Already we have received several
warnings that we aren’t wanted around here,
and I don’t see why we can’t get wise to ourselves
and get out before something happens.
Up to the present time nothing has happened,
but how do you know that something won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
happen that we’ll be pretty sorry for? We
don’t have to go home, but there are places
nearer home where we can camp, and I can
show you a couple of good ones, almost as good
as this one.”</p>

<p>“And then, at the end of the month, we go
back to the trustees and tell them that we were
afraid to use their own camping site and had
to go somewhere else? Let everybody in the
town know that we were scared to death? Is
that what you mean?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No, because if we all agree to keep still
we won’t have to let the story out. We could
even go back and make out that we did stay
in this camp all summer, and who would be
the wiser?”</p>

<p>Ted stood with his hands on his hips, a frown
of contempt on his face. He would have thought
differently about it if it had been one of the
younger boys who had made the request, but
Plum was a big boy and his counsel was dangerous
for the little fellows. Ted longed to take
the big boy and shake him until his teeth
rattled, but he did not feel justified in going
that far. To his mind the question just now
was one of discipline in the matter of going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
bed, and he felt that he must make good on
that first.</p>

<p>“We’ll discuss all that in the morning, right
after breakfast,” he said. “Right now I have
ordered you to bed, and you are going! I’m
the boss of this camp and you fellows are going
to obey me, at least for the present. As to the
idea that I would ever sneak off somewhere
else, and then go back and tell Mr. Calvert that
we had spent the month here, that is so silly
that I won’t even discuss it. You’ve heard what
I said about bed. March to your tents!”</p>

<p>There was one long moment of indecision.
Those back of Ted near the tents watched with
breathless interest to see what the outcome
would be and Buck was prepared to back his
chum up. The smaller boys with Plum hesitated
and looked at him. That Plum was angry
there was no doubt, but he did not know clearly
what to do. He measured Ted up in a glance
and he felt for a moment that he was physically
able to handle him, but he was not so sure
when he looked into Ted’s clear, direct eyes.
They didn’t look uncertain, and he lowered his
own gaze.</p>

<p>“You’ll talk it over in the morning?” he
asked, somewhat lamely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I will. But not another word tonight.”</p>

<p>Plum walked slowly to his tent and the other
boys followed to their own. Ted looked to see
if little Tommy Clayton was with them, but
the small boy was over in front of his own tent,
looking on. As Ted walked back to his tent
they all scattered and were soon undressing,
the lights going out one by one.</p>

<p>The night was quiet and uneventful.</p>

<p>In the morning something radically different
claimed their attention. One of the boys, looking
out of the tent, cried in an excited voice
that there was a bear in the camp. Every head
was thrust out of the flaps, and sure enough,
there near the dead embers of their fire, was a
small brown bear, sniffing around a spot where
some beans had been dropped. The cries of
the boys made him lift his head, and he stared
at them with his small, piggy eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, will he attack us?” a boy asked, in
Buck’s tent.</p>

<p>“No, unless he is pretty desperate for food,
and I don’t see why he should be at this time
of the year,” answered Buck. “I think I can
get rid of him.”</p>

<p>Buck reached into his duffle bag. Drummer
stared in fascination at the undecided bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“Gosh, suppose he ate one of us!” he said.</p>

<p>Charlie Wells grinned at him from another
tent. “I think he came down here just on purpose
to get you, Drummer!” he said. “He
probably heard that you eat more than anybody
else, and he is here to make a meal of you. If
we had to throw somebody out to him to keep
him quiet, we’d throw Drummer, wouldn’t we,
fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” came in a chorus.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it!” returned the fat boy.</p>

<p>Buck appeared in the doorway of the tent
with something in his hand. He drew back his
arm and launched the tennis ball at the bear.
The white ball went straight and true, hitting
the bear on the nose with a whack.</p>

<p>The little bear gave a grunt of surprise,
shook his head in evident perplexity, and turned
and ran at a lumbering trot away from the
camp, pursued by the laughter of the boys. He
disappeared at top speed in the undergrowth
and avoided the camp from that day onward.</p>

<p>Breakfast was eaten cheerfully, the bear incident
having put them all in good spirits, and
afterward Ted addressed them as they sat
around the fire. He talked without heat, but
earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“I want to lay down the law to you fellows,
not in any nasty way, but so that there will be
no mistake,” he said. “From the events which
have gone on around here we know that someone
doesn’t want us in this camp, because if
anyone will go to the trouble to blow a conch
shell and hang up a skeleton, they aren’t fooling.
But we’re not going to run away like a
bunch of babies. I’m responsible for this camp,
and if I went back and said that I couldn’t
hold you here, I would be falling down on a
trust which was committed to me. We’ll show
this prowler, whoever he is, that we have more
right to be here than he has and that we won’t
pack up and move!”</p>

<p>He glanced briefly at Plum. “If any of you
boys have any complaint to make, make it to
Buck or to me. We are the leaders and we’ll
try and do what is right. We’re not going to
run away from this camp just because someone
wants us to, and we’re not going home one
single day before Labor Day! So get that
straight, and also the fact that all orders must
be obeyed without argument. If there are
several bosses around any organization things
jar, and while I don’t want to appear to be
overbearing, Buck and I must have your full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
support. We’ll be fair with you, I promise you
that. That will be all for now.”</p>

<p>The group broke up, scattering to the affairs
at hand. Tom Clayton spoke to the morose
Plum.</p>

<p>“Ted is quite a leader, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He’s too much leader!” was the growled
response.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="fs70">MOUNTAIN CHASE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a few days after Ted’s talk there was
no further trouble of any kind in the camp.
Neither was there any further annoyance upon
the part of the person or persons who had kept
them in an unsettled state of mind for so long.
After a time the boys began to feel that the
person had tired of the contest and had gone
away, for the time being, at least.</p>

<p>After the third day of peace one of the boys
discovered that the skeleton had vanished from
the hollow back of the camp. They had watched
it each day to discover if possible the owner
of the weird thing, but apparently during one
of the slack periods of watching the owner had
come and taken it. This was a relief in one
sense and not in another.</p>

<p>“We’ve had somebody hiding in the bushes
and watching that thing almost every day,”
Ted said to Buck, as they sat apart one day.
“But on the very first day that we didn’t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
somebody, away it went. That looks as though
whoever planted the thing knows our movements
pretty well.”</p>

<p>“He probably knows more about us than
we’d like him to,” was Buck’s comment.</p>

<p>They had been to a farm house nearby to
purchase butter, eggs and milk and Ted had
asked concerning a Doctor Hemple. No one
knew the man or had ever heard of him.</p>

<p>“Our local doctor’s name is Ord,” said the
farmer. “Where’d you hear of this Hemple?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we both know him by name and just
wondered if he came from up this way,” Ted
passed it off.</p>

<p>Buck told of the cabin with the barbed wire
and the farmer knew something, though not
much about it. The owner was a mystery to
everyone, he said.</p>

<p>“He built that cabin nigh onto four years
ago, and he’s a mighty unfriendly critter,”
related the farmer, as he tied up their packages.
“I come through there once from huntin’ and
I had my dog with me. Dog run up to the
cabin—the barbed wire fence wasn’t finished
then—and that feller was settin’ in some kind
of a fancy cheer there. No sooner’d that man
see my dog than he popped out o’ his cheer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
chased him out of the yard like he was the
plague. ‘Dog won’t hurt you, mister,’ I says
‘he’s a mighty friendly dog.’ ‘Don’t keer if
he is!’ yells back the man, ‘don’t want dogs
or humans on my property. What you think
I’m puttin’ up a barbed wire fence for?’ ‘Well,
mister,’ I sez, ‘not wishin’ you any hard luck
or nothin’, I’d like to have a couple of thousand
wild hogs to chase across your front yard!’
That’s the way I felt, too!”</p>

<p>“He must be an unsociable party,” grinned
Buck.</p>

<p>“Worse than that!” was the hearty response.</p>

<p>“What does he look like?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Tall feller with a heavy shock of gray hair,”
replied Farmer Crane. “Got a sort of a long
face with deep black eyes. He looks like he
was a drinker or something, because he looks
worried all the time, least he did all the time
I saw him.”</p>

<p>The supplies which the boys brought back
with them from this trip was eagerly welcomed
at the camp. Then they set to work to make
some improvements in the camp itself. They
cleared away undergrowth which was too close
to the back of the tents. The small truck, which
was marooned up on the dirt road was backed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
down into the camp by means of two sturdy
ropes, its own brakes, and convenient stones.
By snubbing the ropes around trees they were
able to bear the strain of easing the truck down
hill and in its new position it made a convenient
storeroom. There was still the matter of the
ice box.</p>

<p>“How you going to sink it?” Buck asked.</p>

<p>“Straight down in the cool earth beside the
creek,” Ted told him.</p>

<p>“But the dirt is pretty soft there. How will
you keep the sides from caving in and spoiling
everything?”</p>

<p>“We’ve had some unexpected good luck,”
Ted smiled. “Under the seat of the truck I
found six large square pieces of tin, and
although I don’t know what they were intended
for, I am going to use them. I imagine that
they were sent along in case we wanted to use
them for a fireplace, but I guess the use won’t
matter. I’m going to floor and wall the ice
chest with that.”</p>

<p>With a camp shovel Ted and some of the boys
dug a hole a good four feet down into the soft
earth beside the creek and here they placed one
square of tin as the flooring. On the sides they
sheeted with the other pieces of tin, fastening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
them down with hand cut pegs which they drove
right through the tin in the same fashion as
nails. Except for a cover, the ice chest was
complete.</p>

<p>The cover was constructed of sections of a
packing box which they sheeted on the under
side and finished off on the top with a wooden
handle. When all this was finished they had a
cool and serviceable ice chest which would never
get hot or need ice. The perishable articles
were lowered into it, the cover was placed on
top at a depth of about six inches from the surface
of the ground and the task was complete.</p>

<p>“That ought to work all right,” Ted said,
casting an appraising eye over his and his boys’
handiwork.</p>

<p>“Mighty nice piece of work,” approved Buck.</p>

<p>That night Ted called them to attention as
soon as the evening meal was over and asked
them if they wanted to play a night game. The
response was instant and curiosity was expressed
as to the nature of the game.</p>

<p>“This game is called Mountain Chase,” Ted
told them. “We divide up into two squads
and both squads must have lanterns. There
are ten small lanterns in the truck, and that
means that if we can divide into two squads—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
is, if you all will play—there will be a
lantern to every two men. Now, here is the
point. The mountain squad goes out with
lighted lanterns and gets a good twenty-minute
start, time enough in which to lose themselves.
As soon as the twenty minutes are up the camp
squad goes out after them. The object of the
camp squad is to capture the mountain men
before they can sneak back into the camp, and
the mountain men will, of course, try like the
dickens to sneak back past the camp outfit and
win their way into the camp.”</p>

<p>“The lanterns must be kept lighted at all
times. If there is going to be any prowling
around these mountains without a light, it will
be the last time anyone goes out of the camp
at night. We don’t want anybody to fall in a
gully and get hurt. You may hide the lanterns
behind a tree or your body if you think you
hear an enemy coming, but no lights out! That
wouldn’t be fair to the searchers, for you could
slip past them in the darkness and reach the
camp without any trouble. The game is just
a game of skill with the lamps, and dodging
your enemies.”</p>

<p>“How do we capture the other side?” was
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Your enemy must be touched before he is
officially captured, and in that the advantage
is clearly with the camp party, because we’ll
all be travelling in parties of two. Now, if the
camp couple spot a couple of mountaineers
sneaking along, the camp men can split and
then run you down from two angles, though
the split isn’t to be big enough to allow the
man without a lantern to get far away from
it. When the mountaineer with the lantern is
touched he and his partner are both captured.
Is everything clear?”</p>

<p>It seemed that it was and there was vast
enthusiasm over the prospect of an evening of
fun. The two older boys told off the two squads,
lanterns were brought out and lighted, and the
mountain squad prepared to go off.</p>

<p>“Remember, no lights out!” Ted warned
them, as they started off.</p>

<p>Buck was with the mountain squad, paired
off with Drummer, for whom he had a warm
friendship, and at this final word from Ted they
took to the hills, splitting up so that five points
of light went bobbing and turning up into the
darkness of the night, to be eventually blotted
out between the trees.</p>

<p>The twenty minutes seemed a long time to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
the boys who were waiting in the camp. They
were all eagerly interested in the game which
was before them, for on other nights they had
sat around the campfire talking and singing
until it was time to go to bed. There was the
thrill of the unusual and the challenge of a
combat in this, and they were enjoying it to
the utmost, impatient to get into action.</p>

<p>“Time is up,” announced Ted, putting his
watch away and getting up from the log upon
which he was sitting.</p>

<p>They immediately started off in the direction
taken by the other squad, in pairs, with swinging
lanterns which had just been lighted. Ted
had with him the small boy, deeming it wise
to see to it that the small boy was not entrusted
to the care of any one who was not likely to
be too careful of him. The little fellow was
developing under the camp life and Ted felt a
great deal of fondness for him.</p>

<p>They soon left the camp back of them and
arriving at the foot of the mountain, began the
climb. They spread out in fan shape as they
continued, busily watching their step in front
of them and for a sign of a light between the
trees. Sticks and small stones were avoided
so that noise did not betray them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The woods were profoundly still, so much
so that no one would have believed that twenty
active boys were hunting each other. Ted and
Tom crept steadily forward, keeping the lamp
low and peering into the thickets.</p>

<p>“Not a sign of them yet,” Ted began, when
the small boy touched his arm.</p>

<p>“Look down that way, to your left!”</p>

<p>Ted obeyed, and saw at some yards distance
the gleam of a light. It was behind a tall and
pointed rock, and he motioned to his companion
to follow as they crept toward it, keeping their
own light in back of them so that scarcely a
beam from it showed before them.</p>

<p>Ted halted and whispered to the small boy.
“You slip around in front of the rock and I’ll
drop on them from the rear. If they try to
get away from me you just touch the fellow
with the lantern. Don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>As noiselessly as possible Tom slipped away
around the lower side of the rock and Ted
went around the higher side, his lantern held
far to one side so that the beams would not
show. Cautiously he peered over the top and
the sight pleased him. Bob Gilmore and
another boy were standing there, crouching in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the shelter of the big stone, listening and trying
to cover up the lantern beams.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I heard somebody, even if I didn’t
see a light,” Bob was whispering, as Ted looked
down on them.</p>

<p>“But they must be gone now,” his companion
said. “Let’s make a sneak for the camp.”</p>

<p>Ted waited to hear no more, but slid over
the rock and landed beside them. They started
and turned wide eyes upon him, but had presence
of mind to run. But Tom stepped from the
shelter of the rock and touched Bob on the
arm.</p>

<p>“I got you!” cried the small boy, triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are ours,” smiled Ted, taking the
others’ lantern away from them.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to surrender,” admitted
Bob.</p>

<p>In close company they marched back down
the mountain, to find that two other couples
had been captured and that one pair had managed
to return to camp. Only one couple of
each squad was unaccounted for, and presently
Buck and his companion slipped into camp with
the pursuers hard after them.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that means that my side has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
won,” announced Ted. “We captured three
of your teams.”</p>

<p>“You are right and we admit it,” Buck
acknowledged. “I’m afraid we didn’t spread
out enough. Some other night we’ll play it and
change sides.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Well, I guess we are all here, aren’t
we?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“All present,” Buck nodded.</p>

<p>“There must be somebody absent,” piped up
a boy. “There goes a light up the side of the
mountain!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs70">THE LONE LIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>With one accord they turned and looked up
the mountain. Just as the boy had announced,
a single light was moving up, like some firefly
on a wall.</p>

<p>For the moment it was in a cleared space and
they could follow it. In another moment it had
passed from sight and only a fleeting glimpse
was to be seen as it flashed from between a tree
screen.</p>

<p>Ted looked in perplexity around him, counting
the boys. “Twenty, counting myself and
Buck,” he murmured. “We are all here.”</p>

<p>“That must be our party, the gentleman who
has been annoying us,” Buck said, as they
stared up the slope.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is. I wonder if he has any intentions
tonight.”</p>

<p>“Hard to tell. Let’s follow him!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as we ought to do that,” mused
Ted. “Suppose it shouldn’t be the right person?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
If it isn’t the one we think it is, we’ll look silly
chasing him.”</p>

<p>“Why not have half of the gang stay here
in camp while half of us go out and trail him?”
asked Buck, eagerly. “We could see where he
is going, and if he is coming down this way
for any foolishness we’ll have him red-handed.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. All right, I’m willing, but we
can’t all go, because he would surely hear the
noise made by twenty of us. One of us must
stay here in the camp with the boys, and four
or five of us can get on his trail.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Buck, with less enthusiasm than
before.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay here in camp if you want to do
the trailing,” spoke up Ted, quickly, aware of
Buck’s disappointment.</p>

<p>“I’ll stay with the boys and take care of
them,” said Ralph Plum, stepping forward.
The chance of authority was a welcome one and
he had no personal desire to climb the mountain
after the man with the lantern. The two
leaders looked at him in a moment of doubt, but
his size impressed them, and as both of them
wished to do the trailing, they consented.</p>

<p>“All right, you can take charge of the boys,”
nodded Ted. “Bob and Charlie, Drummer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Buck and I will do the trailing. See to it that
the lanterns are put back in the truck before
you turn in or even as soon as possible, Ralph.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the new camp director.
“You kids get busy and put those lanterns in
the wagon.”</p>

<p>“That’s no wagon, it’s a truck,” retorted
one boy.</p>

<p>“Never mind any back talk. I’m in charge
of this camp and I don’t want any suggestions
from anyone,” was the loud answer.</p>

<p>“You won’t be in charge any longer than I
can help it,” thought Ted, as he lighted his
lantern.</p>

<p>When the five trailers were ready Ted gave
Plum some final instructions. “When we come
back to the camp we’ll whistle before we enter,
so you’ll know that we are the ones who are
approaching. If anything goes wrong, blow the
automobile horn, which is detached and in my
tent. We’ll surely hear that and come hotfooting
it back to you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing will go wrong while I’m here!”
returned Plum, with careless ease.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear you so confident,” half-smiled
Ted. “Come on along, fellows.”</p>

<p>With lighted lanterns the others joined him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
and they set off once more for the slopes of
the mountain. Nothing more had been seen of
the vagrant light above them and they realized
that their chase might be a vain one. But none
of them felt content to go to sleep that night
until they knew that everything was safe so far
as the camp was concerned.</p>

<p>The initial climb was a hard one and they
were all panting when they reached a less
abrupt slope of the mountain. Here they halted
to breathe in the air that they felt the need of.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be up to the spot where we saw
him cross that open glade,” Ted said to Buck.
“That is just where I saw the light on the
night I came up here alone.”</p>

<p>They pressed on, gaining the open stretch of
the mountain and crossed this space, looking
down to where the campfires gleamed like small
red dots. They could make out a few of the
boys standing around the fires and they knew
that their progress was being watched. As a
signal, they waved their lanterns.</p>

<p>They had just entered the higher wooded
slope above the cleared spot, when a sound
reached their ears which stopped them in their
tracks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>“What was that?” Bob gasped, looking
around. But the others knew at once.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” Ted said to Buck, raising his
eyebrows significantly.</p>

<p>Buck looked away across the valley in which
Black Riders’ Camp lay. “I don’t see any
sign of lightning,” he said. “Probably it is
miles away from here yet. We can do a little
more hunting around and then go back.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it is worth while?” asked Ted,
looking up the slope. “I haven’t seen any sign
of our friend with his light. Maybe he has
gone home and to bed.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go a little further, anyway,” urged
Buck. “Then we can fetch up in a wide circle
and come in back of the camp. If anything is
wrong down there we ought to arrive in time
to be in on it.”</p>

<p>“Wait until I see what time it is,” Ted
answered, and he glanced at his watch. “Just
ten-thirty. We must get back pretty soon. All
right, let’s go on.”</p>

<p>He wondered if he had been wise in giving
in to Buck, for a more penetrating and rolling
peal of thunder reached their ears, bringing
with it a brooding sense of uneasiness that was
disconcerting. The thunder rolled back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
forth between the mountains, which seemed to
toss it back and forth after a profound rolling
that had a grinding sound attached to it. The
air itself had been comparatively still but now
a faint and disturbing little wind slipped in
and out between the leaves and branches of the
trees. Out of the corner of his eye Drummer
caught a glimpse of a lightning flash.</p>

<p>“I saw that flash of lightning just then,” he
proclaimed, confirming an impression that Ted
had in his own mind. Drummer was not comfortable
and longed to return to camp.</p>

<p>They came to a halt, uncertain, with the
majority desiring to return to camp. Buck
alone wanted to chance the thunder storm
which there was now no doubt in the world was
coming. But he knew that such a course was
foolish and he gave in.</p>

<p>“All right,” he sighed. “I do hate to give
up the chase, though.”</p>

<p>“I guess we all do,” agreed Ted. “But we’ll
have to get right back. It will take us a good
half hour as it is, even if we do have to go
down instead of up, and we will be lucky if we
reach the camp in time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re right there,” his chum agreed,
glancing for the last time up the mountain in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
a searching way. “We simply must get back.
I was just—Ah!”</p>

<p>At the sharp exclamation in his tone the others
looked at him, noted his startled facial expression,
and then glanced up the slope to a ledge
some twenty feet above them, and off to one
side. The lantern was coming toward them,
but even as they looked it stopped, hesitated,
and began a speedy retreat. Whoever was behind
it was represented merely by a blur.</p>

<p>They forgot the advancing storm at once and
set off in pursuit. At the moment of seeing
the light so near to them they were too startled
to move, and had the man with the light advanced
upon them, they would have been frozen
to the spot with apprehension. But now that
the man with the lantern ran from them the
thing was put in a different light. Seeing it
run away put courage into them.</p>

<p>“Stick together and don’t get lost!” cried
Buck, as he ran up the slope to the ledge upon
which the man had been walking.</p>

<p>This ledge could only be climbed by taking
a diagonal course and Charlie Wells complicated
matters by slipping when he was almost
at the top and falling all the way down to the
level upon which they had been a minute or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
previously. Not wishing to run on without
him they were compelled to wait and when he
joined them, adorned with a few cuts and
scratches, they ran on again. When they
rounded a knob of the mountain there was no
light to be seen and they guessed the story
only too well. The mountain man had put his
lantern out and all trace of him was lost, to
the eye at least.</p>

<p>They stood in a cluster listening, but no sound
except the wind greeted them. The stillness
inspired a new idea.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he just put out his light and is
hiding around here somewhere,” said Drummer,
voicing the thought.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that is true,” agreed Ted.
“Well, we don’t care to go looking all around
the bushes for him. I can see now where we
made our mistake in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Buck.</p>

<p>“By going around with five lanterns lighted,
making ourselves absolutely conspicuous,” returned
Ted. “If we had had only one light
we wouldn’t have advertised ourselves as we
did. Perhaps if he hadn’t thought there were
five of us he would have offered to talk or fight
instead of legging it away as fast as he did!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, one light would have been enough,”
admitted Buck.</p>

<p>“Sure it would have! Well, there isn’t anything
that we can do about it now. I——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an ear-splitting crash
of thunder and a flaming tongue of fire flashed
across the mountains, causing them to jump
severely. Ted turned back toward the camp.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’ve simply got to get back
there!” he cried.</p>

<p>They started off on a fast walk, regretting
that they had chased the man with the light as
far as they had. In their enthusiasm they had
covered a long distance and they had not descended
very far down the side of the mountain
before large rain drops began to spatter
through the trees upon them.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’re not going to make it!”
shouted Ted, above the noise of the rising wind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs70">HEAVEN’S ARTILLERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ted’s guess was a perfectly correct one. Before
they were half down the mountain side the
rain began to come down in sheets.</p>

<p>Added to the rush of wind and water there
was the bewildering addition of thunder and
lightning. The thunder kept up the rolling roar
as the sound bounded from mountain slope to
mountain slope, and the flashes of lightning
almost blinded them. The quality of it was
deceptive. It revealed obstacles in the path
which were imaginary most of the time, and by
constant flashing made the lanterns of little or
no use. Two of them had already been puffed
out by the wind and the rain drops on the others
caused them to sputter and hiss. It was with
a sense of feeling rather than seeing their way
that the boys pushed on.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any place that we can duck into
for shelter?” Buck shouted in Ted’s ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know of any,” he replied. “This
is all new country to me.”</p>

<p>“How about that old house?”</p>

<p>“We’re nowhere near it,” was the discouraging
answer as Ted kept on going.</p>

<p>They were frantically seeking a shelter, for
there was no thought in their minds that they
could ever make camp with safety. They could
see the fires in the camp below, now rapidly being
put out by the storm. The rain had increased
in violence and it gave every appearance of
being a violent summer storm.</p>

<p>The glass on one of the lanterns cracked and
broke and the wind promptly snatched out the
dancing flame. But their chief help in their
flight from the storm was the lightning which
flashed with great brilliance. Although it
created illusions it served as a guide and kept
them from running on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>There was a severe crack of thunder, a
dazzling flash of electrical fire hard on its heels,
and a big tree near them seemed outlined for
an instant in quivering fire. The monarch of
the forest split in two, and one portion came
down with a rush and a roar that bewildered
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“That was close!” yelled Drummer, as they
came to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>“We have got to get under some kind of
a cover,” cried Ted, peering around him. “If
we don’t we may have a tree down on top of
us!”</p>

<p>“Let’s try that rock over there,” Buck
pointed out, and they dashed in the direction
of the somewhat vague rock which loomed off
to their left. When they reached it they were
grateful to find that it afforded a slight shelter
at least from falling trees, though as a covering
for rain it was a total failure.</p>

<p>The rock was small at the base and towered
above their heads, mushrooming out as it went
up, until the top was a flat surface which would
hold all five of them without crowding, had they
been in any mood to sit on the top of the big
rock. But they crouched at the base of the
big stone and there prepared to make the best
of it, striving to keep the two good lanterns
going, for in their present predicament even
a little light was welcome.</p>

<p>“This is better than nothing at all!” declared
Bob, pushing his back up as close to the
rock as it would go.</p>

<p>“We’re safe from falling trees, anyway,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
observed Charlie, as he set his useless lamp to
one side and jammed his hands into his pockets.</p>

<p>“Not the dryest place in the world!”
chuckled Ted.</p>

<p>The rain slanted right into their faces,
causing them to avert them, and the drippings
from the top of the rock spattered over them.
A thin trickle oozed down the sleek sides of
the big stone and made their backs more wet
than ever. Their plight was not a happy or
a comfortable one.</p>

<p>“What I wouldn’t do with a good old
fire right now!” sighed Drummer, shivering
slightly.</p>

<p>“Here, hold your hands over the top of the
lantern,” directed Ted, and Drummer followed
his instructions and found the warmth welcome.</p>

<p>“I wonder how the fellows in camp are
making it?” Ted worried, as the lightning
flashes grew less frequent. “Of course they
have the tents, but I wonder if they knew
enough to loosen up on the tent ropes so as to
take the strain off of the pegs? I won’t be
surprised if we get back and find that half of
the pegs have been pulled out of the ground!”</p>

<p>“How does that work, Ted?” Bob asked,
with interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Why, when a storm is coming up a camper
must loosen up on his tent ropes, because when
the canvas gets wet it pulls pretty strongly on
the ropes, and if they haven’t been attended
to they pull right out of the ground. If that
business hasn’t been done I’ll have only myself
to blame, for I neglected to tell you all about
it. Never gave it a thought, though I should
have at the time we dug the trenches around
the tents.”</p>

<p>“It is a mighty good thing that we did dig
the trenches,” put in Buck, all crouched in a
heap. “Those fellows would be good and wet
by this time if we hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt but what they are right now,”
said Ted, seriously. “With a fall of rain like
this those trenches couldn’t possibly carry off
all of the water. I think that we’ll all have to
do some drying out when we get the fires
started again and get back to normal!”</p>

<p>“The lightning is letting up, but listen
to that thunder!” remarked Buck. “That’s
heaven’s artillery for fair!”</p>

<p>A full and weary hour dragged by while they
remained there in the shelter of the big rock
waiting for the storm to cease. The lightning
had moved on across the mountain and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
thunder was about to follow. The rolls of the
pealing concussions now came to them in a
more muffled state and the rain was beginning
to thin out though it did not cease to fall. They
had hopes of making a break when the thunder
and lightning had passed away.</p>

<p>“We won’t stay here just for the sake of
the rain,” said Ted. “We couldn’t possibly
get any wetter than we are, so as soon as we
are sure that there will be no more lightning
we’ll make a dash for it.”</p>

<p>“Better be careful of your dashes,” warned
Buck. “The ground has become very slippery
and we’ll have to watch our steps.”</p>

<p>“We’ll keep our eyes wide open,” promised
Ted. “I guess we can go now.”</p>

<p>The five wet and stiff boys stood up straight,
stretching their aching muscles. After the
game of the evening, the chase over the mountains,
and the thorough wetting, all of them felt
worn out and stiff. It was with genuine
pleasure that they looked forward to the return
to the camp, for the exercise alone.</p>

<p>“It isn’t going to do us much good to get to
camp,” said Drummer. “There won’t be any
wood to start a fire with.”</p>

<p>“This storm has taught me a big lesson,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
said Ted. “Hereafter we’ll have a shelter for
a pile of dry wood, for just such an emergency
as this. But don’t forget, Drummer, there are
warm blankets for us to wrap around us when
we do get there.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” the other realized, brightening.
“That will help a lot.”</p>

<p>They hurried away from the big rock and
made their way to the best of their belief
toward their camp. They had not gone very
far, however, before Bob cried out in dismay.</p>

<p>“My lantern is going out! Guess all the oil
is burned up.”</p>

<p>With a flutter his light went out, leaving them
with but one good lantern among them. For a
moment they were at a loss, for the mountains
were very dark and slippery and if the last
light went out their case would not be a happy
one.</p>

<p>“Well, we still have one left and there must
be a little oil in the other lanterns,” said Ted.
“We’ll push along with the one light and if
that goes out we’ll refill my lantern with the
oil from the others.”</p>

<p>They continued on their way for some time,
moving in the general direction of the camp.
The ground was indeed muddy and treacherous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
and they were compelled to watch every footstep.
As they rounded a point on the mountain
Buck paused and pointed to a light below them.</p>

<p>“Hello, we have certainly wandered off of
our course, all right! There is the cabin of
that unsociable fellow that the farmer told us
about.”</p>

<p>They looked down into the slight valley to
the cabin before them, noting with some envy
the lighted windows, speculating on the warmth
and cheer which was inside. The light in the
cabin was a good one and the square panes of
glass released broad floods of yellow illumination.
As they looked the door opened and a
tall man came to the door looking out.</p>

<p>“Duck the lantern!” whispered Buck, and
Ted dropped it behind a bunch of bushes.</p>

<p>The man looked up at the sky, apparently
wishing to see if the storm had passed over.
He was much as the farmer had described him
and he was dressed in an odd costume for a
backwoods cabin, for he had on a soft white
shirt and white flannel trousers.</p>

<p>“My, my, what a nice looking pioneer he is!”
muttered Buck as the man retired.</p>

<p>“Buck, do you know what I think?” asked
Ted, slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if that man is
the one who has been annoying us in our
camp!”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence and the boys
all looked at Ted. “What makes you think
so?” Buck asked.</p>

<p>“You remember what that farmer told us
about the very unfriendliness of the man? I
wouldn’t be surprised if he just resented our
camping anywhere near him and he tried to
chase us away.”</p>

<p>“You think he is the man we chased, with
the lantern, tonight?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Anyway, he had time to get
back to his cabin and change his clothes. I
wouldn’t be a bit surprised to find that he is
the one. But come on, we won’t get anywhere
by just standing around here.”</p>

<p>They continued on their way to camp, talking
over Ted’s theory, and the more that they
talked of it the more plausible it seemed. They
felt that they had made an important discovery.</p>

<p>“Maybe he has tired of his effort to scare
us away,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“I hope so. We’re not going, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah, there is the camp!” cried Charlie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
as they reached the bottom of the slope and
started across the basin towards the tents.</p>

<p>Ted was in the lead and he quickened his
steps, looking ahead into the darkness. There
was a sound of scrambling and jumping which
he could not understand and the spot looked
curiously empty.</p>

<p>“Why, the tents are all down!” he exclaimed,
running forward.</p>

<span class="fs70">BUCK MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The one lantern carried by Ted threw but a
poor light over the scene of the camp but it
was enough for the arriving boys to see that
all of the tents were down, apparently blown
over from the storm. The first two were down
altogether, canvas and poles, while the last two
consisted of flapping canvas on the poles.
While they looked they were joined by the other
boys, who came jumping and running from the
truck, where they had taken a poor refuge
during the storm.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, I’m glad you are back!” exclaimed
Plum, fervently, catching Ted by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“What happened here?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Why, the storm blew the tents down. We
were all under the canvas and keeping pretty
dry, except for some water which leaked in
from the trenches, when all of a sudden there
was a blow of wind and the tents were down.
It even carried over the poles on two of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
tents, or else we knocked them down getting
out, I don’t know which. But we were soaked
and tried to get in the truck and pull a piece
of canvas over our heads, but it didn’t do us
much good.”</p>

<p>Apparently, it had not. All of them were as
wet as the five who had been trailing. With
the tents down and all of them dripping they
presented a sorry sight which even the flicker
of the one lamp could not make up for. Looking
backward, the evening did not seem to have
been a success.</p>

<p>“Well, only one thing to do,” directed Buck,
briskly. “Let’s locate our axes and hunt dry
wood for a fire.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any dry wood,” a boy objected.</p>

<p>“We can get dry wood by taking a fairly
large log and chopping off the wet outside,”
explained Buck. “In that way we’ll get down
to the heart of it and find something that we
can burn. You know where that dead log is
back of the springs, and you can surely cut
something dry out of that big fellow. Come on,
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>Buck went to the mass of canvas which had
been his own tent and lifting the soggy material,
felt inside for his axe, which he had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
trouble in locating. The other boys procured
theirs and then they went off in a body to hunt
up dry wood, a seemingly impossible process.
But Buck had had to deal with wet wood before
in his camping experiences.</p>

<p>“Now, here is this log,” he told them. “The
outside looks pretty wet, and it is wet. Start
cutting it away in slices, this way.” With his
axe he split the wood along the upper side,
tearing off the wet strips and tossing them to
one side. “Now, here is some that looks fairly
dry,” he went on, as they cut deeper. “This
stuff will do very nicely for our fire.”</p>

<p>The younger boys were surprised to find that
there was indeed a goodly supply of dry wood
in the old log and they gathered a large heap
of it and took it back to the camp. Buck knew
that they were going to need lots of it, for it
was impossible to think of going to bed that
night. The wet canvas could not be put up and
the entire camp would have to be dried out.
They would need wood for the entire night.</p>

<p>“They are all excited and won’t mind staying
awake all night,” he reflected, as he carried
an armful of wood back to the fireplaces.</p>

<p>Here he found Ted down on his knees cleaning
out the wet mass of ashes which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the evening’s fire and when these had been
raked out and scattered to one side, some paper,
which came from under the seat of the truck
was stuffed into the stone fireplaces and the
wood was piled so as to catch fire. A match
was applied and the tiny spurt of flame which
immediately jumped up was a very welcome
one. The one faithful lamp was still going and
had done its duty well.</p>

<p>Carefully they fed the flame with splinters
of wood, and the building of the fire took care,
for the log wood was not thoroughly dry, but
had in it enough moisture to make it a problem.
It smoked and drove them away from the fire
more than once, but they were pleased to see
that it did burn. Some good fuel was added
in the form of a canned goods box which had
been under the truck and so was not very wet.
Around the blaze created by this wood they
dried their clothing as much as they could.</p>

<p>“We can’t go to bed tonight, can we?” Tom
Clayton asked.</p>

<p>“No, we couldn’t get the tents up tonight,
because we’ll have to dry them,” replied Ted.
“But the night won’t last so very long now.
When we do get everything fixed up we’ll put
in the daytime sleeping, if we feel that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“I certainly would like to go to sleep right
now!” yawned Drummer, stretching himself.</p>

<p>“I guess most of us would,” nodded Buck.
“But everything is against us. How would
you like to snuggle down under that canvas
right now?”</p>

<p>“Ugh, not while it is as wet as it is!” cried
Drummer. “I’d rather stand up around the
fire all night!”</p>

<p>“Is everything soaked, blankets, sweaters
and everything?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Buck. “As soon as the canvas
fell on the stuff it all got soaked, at least
in the tents where the poles went down. I don’t
know about the other two.”</p>

<p>Some of the boys rummaged under the canvas
and found that blankets were damp and
not too wet to put on, and immediately they
returned with blankets over their shoulders.
Others had not been so lucky and they crowded
close to the fire. As morning came on another
group went out and hunted for wood, bringing
back a large supply. The fire had been effective
but not perfect, and the smoke had chased them
from side to side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>It was the first really disagreeable camp experience
that these boys from the club had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
had and some were plainly discouraged by it
while others enjoyed the novelty and adventure
of it. The conversation by the fire became more
cheerful and soon jokes and laughter took the
place of brooding silence. The five who had
trailed the man with the lantern told their
experiences and those who had remained in
camp told theirs.</p>

<p>“We were just standing around watching
your lights when the storm was first heard,”
related Plum. “We hoped you’d come down
right away, but you didn’t and then the old
storm hit and we dug for the tents. We sat in
there pretty dry except for some water that
came in around the bottom of the tent and then
all of a sudden there was a little blow and the
tent I was in came down! Seemed like the canvas
on one side just collapsed, the back pole
seemed to come down in a hurry and I guess we
knocked the rest down when we tried to get
out from under. The rest was the same as we
was, scrambling out of tents and looking for
somewhere to go, when we thought of the truck
and climbed in there.”</p>

<p>“I knew that it blew pretty hard when we
were up there under the rock,” remarked Ted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
“But I didn’t know that it blew hard enough
to blow down the tents.”</p>

<p>“The wind must have been stronger down
here than it was up there,” suggested Bob.</p>

<p>“That is hardly possible, because the wind
always blows harder on a higher level than in
a basin, such as this spot is. I can see how a
wind would blow down one tent but it seems
funny that it should blow down four of them.
However, I guess it must have just swooped
down in a sudden gust and done the job.”</p>

<p>“Which way did our tent buckle in?” Buck
asked Plum.</p>

<p>“From the left side,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t have,” said a boy, promptly.
“Ours went in on the right!”</p>

<p>“One of you must be wrong,” said Buck.
“The wind must have come from one direction
to have force enough to flatten out the tents,
and it would have hit either on the right or the
left side and not on both. How about you fellows
in the first two tents?”</p>

<p>“Ours went in on the left,” said a boy from
the second tent.</p>

<p>“But ours collapsed on the right,” said Tom
Clayton.</p>

<p>Buck snatched up the lantern. “I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
there was something funny about that tent business
all along,” he said. “Wait until I come
back.” He strode off with the lantern, leaving
them wondering.</p>

<p>Buck went to the tents and placed the lantern
on the ground. The canvas had fallen in a confused
mass and he was compelled to fish under
it for the ropes. He located the ropes which
had been pegged into the ground and examined
them carefully. Without saying anything he
examined the others, passing from tent to tent.</p>

<p>“Find anything?” Ted hailed him, from the
fire.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” was the vigorous answer. “These
tent ropes were cut!”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Ted, leaping to his feet.</p>

<p>“That is just what happened. Come here.”</p>

<p>The entire group clustered around Buck as
he held up ropes from two of the tents. “Look
here. One fellow says his tent collapsed from
the left and another fellow says his let go from
the right. Good reason why. Somebody stood
between two tents and cut the ropes under cover
of the storm. Of course the tents went down
on opposite sides, and I suppose the man
shoved the back poles and skipped to the next
two tents and cut the ropes there. He didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
have time to knock over the uprights there, because
the boys were swarming out, so he left
that to them and probably took to the woods.
Look at these ropes.”</p>

<p>There was not the slightest doubt in the world
that the ropes to the tents had been cut, and cut
with a sharp knife which had required no second
cuts. They stared at the ends of the ropes in
amazement.</p>

<p>“We didn’t hear anybody,” said Plum.
“Probably you wouldn’t, with the noise of
the storm. If we want any additional proof
that the ropes were cut and not pulled, look at
the tent pegs. They are all in the ground as
they were when we left and the other pieces of
the rope are still attached. There is no doubt
that you boys had a visitor while we were chasing!”</p>

<p>“It might have done us more good to have
stayed at home and minded our business,”
smiled Ted.</p>

<p>“Maybe. Say, how near the end of the storm
did this thing happen?”</p>

<p>“Almost at the end,” said Plum. “Just
when the thunder was going away.”</p>

<p>“Then that kills our theory about the man
in the log cabin,” Buck said to Ted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it does,” replied his chum. “He
couldn’t possibly be the one, because if he had
been in on this he couldn’t possibly have returned
to his house and changed his clothes.”</p>

<p>“No, he is out of it,” agreed Buck. “But
who in the world can be doing all this business?
I tell you, I’m getting sick and tired of it and
I’m going to break loose before long and hunt
somebody down.”</p>

<p>“The trouble with your breaking loose is that
we don’t know who to hunt down!” smiled Ted.</p>

<p>“No, that is the trouble. But someone is responsible.
I don’t believe it is any supernatural
element, either, or if it is, that ghost
carries a fine sharp knife! When it gets light
enough we’ll have to look around for footprints.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be long before it is light now,”
said Charlie, glancing at the sky.</p>

<p>The last of the darkness was beginning to
break in the east, a broad bar of yellow-white
light was appearing. Far over in the west the
last of the stars began to fade and as the minutes
ticked off the band of light spread and
broadened and the aspect of the woods changed.
The darkness withdrew and the flush of a new
and beautiful day appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Golly, I never was so glad to see the daytime
come!” sighed Drummer, as they stood
around the fires watching the advance of the
day.</p>

<p>“I guess none of us ever was,” agreed Buck.
“And could I eat!”</p>

<p>“Then let’s get at it right now,” said Ted.
“We’ll have an early breakfast and then get
to work. We are going to have a busy day.”</p>

<span class="fs70">THE STORY OF THE BLACK RIDERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sun seemed to burst forth from the sky,
flooding over the camp as it did so, and never
before had the great ball of fire seemed so comforting
and cheerful. The fires were going
briskly and the coffee was sending out its
tempting aroma. Drummer, warming up
throughout, was inspired to joke.</p>

<p>“Hey, you fellows!” he cried. “Who is going
to take their morning dip in Bear Creek?”</p>

<p>A medley of groans greeted him and he grinned.
“We ought to toss you in for even suggesting
such a thing!” grinned Buck, as he fried
the bacon.</p>

<p>The touch of the sun turned the camp into a
new place. Their spirits rose visibly and all
the uncertainty of the night passed away. No
one felt the loss of sleep, and while the breakfast
squad was busy another detachment took
the wet canvas and spread it out to dry. The
blankets and all personal effects were next in
line and were hung on convenient limbs to partake
of the beneficial sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately for them it was a warm day and
things began to dry at once. As the heat increased
they began to shed outer garments so
as to give them a chance to dry also. The chill
was out of their bodies and they felt perfectly
normal.</p>

<p>“I feel better than I did before I got all
wet!” declared one boy.</p>

<p>“You’ll probably have a reaction later on,”
advised Ted. “I mean that you’ll probably get
tired and want to sleep. We’ll all try a little
sleep after we get the tents up again.”</p>

<p>The call for breakfast was now issued and
disregarded by no one. With whoops of delight
they trooped around, tin plates thrust forward,
and for several minutes the cooks were busy
young men. Never before had breakfast tasted
so good, and there was a general satisfaction
expressed.</p>

<p>“The cooks are putting their best into it this
morning,” said Drummer.</p>

<p>“No differently than other mornings,”
smiled Ted. “But you are hungrier.”</p>

<p>After breakfast the camp was cleaned up, the
canvas reversed and the blankets treated in the
same manner. There was also another problem
before them and this had to do with the icebox.
It had filled up with water and they had to
take everything out of it, pull out some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
tin sheeting, and allow the water to seep into
the ground.</p>

<p>“We didn’t make it water-tight,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“No, and the rain last night was so hard that
it just settled above the cover and leaked
through. I see now where we have made a mistake.
Instead of sinking the ice chest so deep
we ought to build it up a bit and have the cover
above ground, with sloping sides, so that the
water would run away from it. In that way a
few drops might leak in, but not a couple of
quarts as it did last night.”</p>

<p>Later in the day they made the improvement
and did not have any further trouble with wet
weather in regard to their provisions. Then
they turned their attention to the tents, after
having looked around back of them for footprints,
but there were none, so they gave it up.</p>

<p>“We might find some way back in the
bushes,” said Ted. “But we’ll look ’em up
some other time. Let’s see what we can do
with the tents.”</p>

<p>They presented quite a problem, for the cut
rope had to be tied together. There was no
extra rope to be had and while they were tieing
pieces together Ted had an idea.</p>

<p>“Look here, I’ve got an idea which will keep
us from using pegs or having to tie all these
ropes to the smaller pieces.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“What is it? I don’t see how—”</p>

<p>“The tent ropes on one side of each tent are
still tied to the pegs, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, the ropes have been cut on the sides
of the tents facing each other. Instead of
bothering to tie new ropes and peg them down,
lets tie the ropes from each tent together and
simply lay a heavy log across the ropes. That
will be heavy enough to hold down the canvas
and when it rains again we won’t have to loosen
ropes because as the canvas tightens it will
simply raise the weighing logs a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Say, that’s fine! We’ll do that!” approved
Buck.</p>

<p>On the sides of the tents where the cut ropes
faced each other the boys tied them together
and then came the problem of logs. They did
not want to use old half-rotted logs and they
did not care to cut down good trees. Buck suggested
that they seek out some trees that were
dead but still standing, and this they did, finding
more than enough of such trees. As soon
as the best ones had been picked out they cut
them down to the desired length, brought them
back to camp, and then laid them across the
ropes which stretched from tent to tent. Immediately
they weighed the canvas down by
their pressure on the ropes much as pegs would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
have drawn them tightly, and altogether proved
themselves satisfactory.</p>

<p>“By George, any camp where they had more
than one tent, could do that, and it would be
an improvement on pegs!” approved Buck.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly an improvement,” Ted
shook his head. “Pegs give a more direct and
downward pull. But the logs make a good substitute.
It surely makes the camp look funny.”</p>

<p>The sight of the three logs hanging on the
ropes between tents might have puzzled anyone
who did not understand them, but the boys were
content with their work. The camp was now in
good condition and the reaction set in soon after
the noon meal. The excitement and work had
kept them all wide awake, but now yawns began
to be heard from them.</p>

<p>“All of you fellows who want to can turn
in for a good sleep,” said Ted. “Just roll up
in your blankets and snooze away! Everyone
who doesn’t feel like sleeping will please be
quiet and give the others a chance.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know who won’t be sleeping,”
Bob smiled, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to sleep right away,” replied
Ted. “Buck and I are going over to the farmhouse
where we buy the fresh supplies and get
some stuff. When we get back we’ll turn in.”</p>

<p>The other boys straggled off at once to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
tents, and wrapping themselves in their
blankets, fell asleep without any trouble. Fortunately,
the sun had passed far enough behind
the trees so that the rays did not beat down on
the tents and they had no great difficulty in
getting to sleep. Ted and Buck put empty
knapsacks on their backs and started off for
the farmhouse where they bought their provisions.</p>

<p>“I certainly won’t mind a little sleep myself,”
yawned Buck, as they left the camp.</p>

<p>“I won’t either,” his companion remarked.
“But we’ll get back in time to snatch a few
hours when we do get back.”</p>

<p>“Think we’ll learn anything from Farmer
Crane?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I hope so. This thing is
getting serious. So far the boys haven’t been
bad about it, although some of them are pretty
scared at times, but I don’t know how long it
will last. The uncertainty of it wears us down.
We don’t know when somebody is going drop
in and play a trick on us. I want to find out
what it is all about.”</p>

<p>“If we find the person who is doing it,” said
Buck, slowly, “we’ll surely tell him a thing
or two!”</p>

<p>“If we ever catch him around the camp we’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
turn him over to the police in short order,”
was Ted’s grim promise.</p>

<p>The farmer was glad to see them and he listened
with interest to their story of the cutting
of the tent ropes during the storm. It was felt
that there was no need to tell him anything else,
for fear that it would get abroad too much. The
farmer was interested and excited.</p>

<p>“Somebody must have a grudge agin you
fellers!” he cried. “Nobody’d be doing that
for fun.”</p>

<p>“It must be somebody up this way, then,”
said Ted. “Somebody doesn’t want us around.
We thought it was that fellow you spoke to us
about, the man who lives over in the log cabin,
but he couldn’t have been the one, because we
saw him a few minutes before all this happened.”</p>

<p>“Can’t think of no one else, ’less it could of
been old Jerry Jackson, who lives over in Hogs’
Hollow,” mused the farmer.</p>

<p>“Where is Hogs’ Hollow?”</p>

<p>“’Bout a mile beyond where your camp is.
It is a swampy sort of a place not fit for nothin’
but hogs to live in, and old Jerry has a shack
there. But he never bothers no one and I don’t
know why he’d ever want to chase you out of
there.”</p>

<p>“I guess he couldn’t have anything to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
it,” agreed Ted. “By the way, what is that
house way up on the mountain, the one where
the furniture is still in the place? Looks like
it was furnished and never used.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the Bainbridge place,” was the
reply. “Rich feller by the name of Bainbridge
built that house for his wife and it sure was a
handsome dwellin’! I saw it when it was first
finished, and I want to tell you it had more gilt
and brass and blue and everything than any
place I ever saw. Well, Bainbridge was lookin’
forward to bringin’ his wife up there—she’d
never seen it—when she decided she wasn’t
goin’ to live up in no mountains, and she finally
up and run off with somebody else. Bainbridge
spent a lot of time mopin’ around the place
and acted like he was half-crazy, and then finally
he disappeared. Nobody knows where he is
today.”</p>

<p>“That fellow over in the cabin isn’t Bainbridge,
is he?” Buck asked, quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I know both of ’em by sight, and
that ain’t him. No, unless Bainbridge’s ghost
is hangin’ around that old house. I don’t know
where he is.”</p>

<p>They paid for their provisions and then
tramped back to camp, discussing the affair between
them. Nothing definite appeared to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
been learned from the farmer and they decided
to keep a stricter lookout in the camp.</p>

<p>“If we ever hear anybody around in the
bushes we’ll have to make a dash for them,”
said Buck.</p>

<p>Arriving at the camp they found it apparently
deserted and perfectly quiet, but a glance
into the tents showed that all of the boys were
asleep. Very quietly they packed the provisions
in the improved ice chest, and then as
quietly crawled into their blankets for a nap.
For the next three hours the camp was so still
that anyone looking down upon it would have
decided that it was deserted, and then, as the
coolness of the evening came on, first one and
then another began to stir, until the whole camp
was awake.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten and then they sat around,
content to remain in the camp. Just before
they turned in there was a dispute about the
Black Riders and Ted was called upon.</p>

<p>“It was started by a man named Simon
Reed,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think many of us know the story,”
Alfred Paulson said, thoughtfully. “Won’t you
tell it to us, Ted?”</p>

<p>“You want me to tell you the story of the
Black Riders?” Ted asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>There was a general nod of assent. He looked
at his watch, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“It is getting too late now,” he said. “But
I’ll tell it to you after supper tomorrow night.”</p>

<p>Back of them a stick broke sharply and a few
of them turned their heads to look in the direction
of the tents. But in the talk that followed
no one paid any further attention to it.</p>

<p>On the following evening, after the supper,
Ted faced an expectant group of boys. They
were ranged in a bow formation, with the ends
drawn in toward the middle, and Ted stood
near the fire. They were very quiet and he began
at once.</p>

<p>“Most of you fellows know something about
the history of the Revolutionary War at the
time that Washington and his men were in Valley
Forge, about forty miles from here, and the
British were having a gay old time in Philadelphia.
The British and the Hessians were all
around here, a fine, fully equipped army of men,
while the ragged, cold, heroic Americans were
freezing over in Valley Forge. That was in the
winter of 1777 and 1778, if my memory serves
me correctly, and things in this particular part
of the country were in pretty bad shape.”</p>

<p>“There was a man down in Germantown by
the name of Simon Reed, and he was a patriot
who had never run away even in the face of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
British. He knew that up in these mountains
there were some wild, hard-fighting farmers,
and he used to slip out this way nights to get
them organized. Right in this hollow they used
to meet, all dressed in black, all of them riding
black horses, and here they’d make up their
plans to annoy the British. They used to go
stealing out of here and lay in wait for stray
British baggage trains, and then they’d swoop
down on them and capture them. All through the
winter they did such good work for Washington
that they came to be recognized as the Black
Riders. You know, during the Revolution,
there were a number of cracker-jack bands of
fighting men who just hung onto the British
flanks and worried them to death, Marion’s men
in the South, and Morgan’s Riflemen, Light-Horse
Harry Lee’s men, and others. These
Black Riders were a smaller bunch, but they
helped a lot.”</p>

<p>“After awhile things got so hot for them
around here that Washington had them taken
into the regular army as part of Light-Horse
Harry Lee’s division and they ceased to be
known as the Black Riders from then on. But
people around here always remembered them
from the days before they joined Lee and this
spot had always been known as their camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Gosh, that’s a great story!” exclaimed
Drummer.</p>

<p>“It must have been great to have met here
and planned their raids,” said another boy,
looking around him.</p>

<p>“Wish I could see what one looked like,”
said Bob Gilmore.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth
when something happened which left the boys
speechless with wonder. There was a soft flare
of light near them and they all turned their
heads toward the end of the camp nearest the
foot of the mountains, to where a flat, moss-covered
rock jutted out. There on the rock,
lighted by the soft, noiseless glow, was a black
horse and seated upon it, a rider dressed entirely
in black, with a wide black hat pulled over his
face. The glow burned only for a brief second,
but in that second horse and rider stared
straight ahead, and then the flare went out, and
the Black Rider and his black horse disappeared
from view.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="fs70">MUTINY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The silence that succeeded the vision of the
Black Rider on the rock was a vast and throbbing
one, and the senses of the boys reeled
slightly under the shock. Ted still stood in his
position staring toward the rock on which the
fascinating thing had showed, his heart beating
like a trip-hammer and his mouth curiously
dry. In the very atmosphere there was a sense
of unreality.</p>

<p>The figure had been real, yet ghostly. All of
them were sure that they had seen an actual
man seated on a very real horse exposed for an
instant on the rock, and yet the very immoveableness
of it inspired a feeling of awe. There
was no second flush of light and nothing broke
the silence.</p>

<p>Then the tongues of the boys were unloosed
like a flood and they all talked at once. They
scrambled to their feet, confused and uncertain.
The fire had burned so low that the darkness
pressed in tightly upon them, and a few,
with more presence of mind than the rest, threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
some fresh wood on the fire, where it blazed
up and dimly showed the rock upon which the
Black Rider had appeared. But there was no
sign of him now.</p>

<p>“What in the world do you suppose that
was?” Buck demanded, bounding to Ted’s
side.</p>

<p>“You certainly have me,” was the fervent
reply. “I never saw anything like it in my life.
Bob had just said that he would like to see a
Black Rider and one just glowed out. It is beyond
me.”</p>

<p>“If anybody believes in ghosts, that was
surely a ghost of a former Black Rider,” said
Buck. “But there is a trick in it somewhere.
Look how he just glowed and then went out.
Come on, let’s investigate that rock.”</p>

<p>Without argument Ted took the lantern and
he had taken two strides before Buck could
catch up with him. Ted was trying to get the
incident straight in his mind and he was eager
to see that rock. A few of the boys straggled
after them, but the bigger group remained near
the campfires.</p>

<p>Arriving at the rock the two older boys
quickly bent forward and looked at the flat top
of the big stone. There was a slight film of
moss on it and the moss was marked by the feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of a horse, very faintly, but marked, nevertheless.</p>

<p>“Well, it was a sure enough horse, anyway,”
commented Ted, as he kept flashing the light
around the rock. “Look here!”</p>

<p>He pointed out a thin white line with purple
edges which ran across the rock. Buck studied
it, but for the moment its meaning escaped him.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Evidently it was a line of powder, something
like flashlight powder, only calculated to
burn longer,” explained Ted. “Whoever led
the horse out here set a powder train and then
got on the horse and waited. He must have
been able to hear all that we said around the
campfire, and Bob’s words gave him just the
cue he wanted. Somehow or other, maybe by
a small pocket battery wire, he set off the powder
and played spirit, if that is what he was
meant to be.”</p>

<p>“I guess that is so,” nodded Buck. “Say,
you remember that snapping sound we heard
last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I guess I see what you mean.
This fellow must have heard us planning and
then he planned a little plan of his own. I’ll
bet that fellow is in and around our camp more
than we know about!”</p>

<p>“Believe me, we must lay our hands on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
fellow,” said Buck, grimly. “We had better
begin to lay some traps for him when we get
back.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve simply got to get him. Come
on and see if we can follow the tracks of the
horse’s hoofs.”</p>

<p>They were able to find the spot where the
horse had stepped onto the rock and a few hoof
prints nearby, but the man who had arranged
the thing had done his work well. For yards
around the ground was half rock and no print
showed.</p>

<p>“No use hunting around any more tonight,”
said Ted, after they had spent a half hour in
fruitless effort. “In daylight we might be able
to see something worth while, but never with the
light of the lantern. I think those hoofs must
have been muffled.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is no doubt of that,” replied Buck.
“There was no sound when the horse was led
out on the rock and no sound when he retreated.
This man knows what he is doing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and do you know, we’re dealing with an
educated man and no Jerry Jackson from
Hogs’ Hollow. This man knows more than one
thing and when we find a man who is a historian
we’ll have our man. He knew just how a Black
Rider should be dressed and he did the thing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
perfection. Maybe he is doing it for a big joke,
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“But cutting our tent ropes is no joke, I don’t
care how well educated a man is!” reminded
Buck, as they made their way back toward the
camp.</p>

<p>“Oh, I agree with you there and I must confess
that I can’t begin to see his idea. If he
just wants to get rid of us, he is going to a lot
of trouble, because we aren’t going. On the
other hand, is there something around there
that he doesn’t want us to see or know it is
going on?”</p>

<p>“That is something we’ll have to find out,”
Buck answered. “I hope we find out soon, too,
because this stuff is getting my goat. Well, I
see that the boys are still around the fires. They
must have received a pretty rough shock this
time.”</p>

<p>As the two chums approached the group they
noted that there were two distinct sections of
it, one centering around Drummer and the other
around Ralph Plum. They were strangely silent
as the two leaders came in and no one asked a
single question.</p>

<p>“Well, somebody likes to play jokes on us,
and that Black Rider one was a good one,”
smiled Ted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>“That wasn’t a joke, Thorn,” said Ralph
Plum, quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it was a joke,” countered
Ted. “We found that somebody had put some
light powder on the rock and then lighted it so
as to show himself off as a Black Rider. If
they didn’t do it for a joke, I don’t know what
they did it for.”</p>

<p>“Well, some of us are through with this
camping trip,” said Plum. “We’re going
home!”</p>

<p>Ted counted the boys who were grouped
around Plum. “Seven of you,” he said, coolly.
“All of you going home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are going home and I’m going to
take them home,” sneered Plum, his self-control
breaking down. Each day had added to his
irritation at the small part he played in the
camp and he was aroused at the chance which
had come his way. “These boys aren’t safe
in this camp and I’m going to take them home
and let their parents know that I brought them
safely home, too!”</p>

<p>Ted smiled slightly. “Yes, I’m pretty sure
that you’ll do that, Plum!”</p>

<p>Ralph Plum stepped closer and tapped Ted
on the chest. “You know just a little too much,
Thorn! I don’t like the way you have been
running this camp, anyway. I’m one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
older fellows here and I wasn’t even made a
tent captain. My family gave money to this club
and I don’t even get any recognition out of it.
I told you several days ago that this camp
wasn’t safe and you wouldn’t listen and go
somewhere else. Now, I’m going to take these
boys home with me, and you won’t stop me!”</p>

<p>Ted’s temper trembled dangerously, but he
turned to the other boys. “Do you boys want
to go home?” he asked them. They looked at
each other and then one or two nodded.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they really want to go,” cried
out Drummer, angrily. “Plum has been telling
them that they ought to go home and making
up big yarns about something happening
to them if they don’t get out of here! All he
wants is to get them home and get a lot of
credit for it!”</p>

<p>“Say, you just keep your——” began Plum,
lunging toward Drummer, who immediately
struck an attitude of defense.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” Ted cut in, stopping
Plum’s rush. “Is it true that you have been
working up fear in the minds of the boys?”</p>

<p>“No!” shouted Plum. “But some of us decided
that we have had enough of this camp and
that we are going home. You can’t stop us,
Thorn.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to stop you,” replied Ted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
quietly. “If you want to go, you can go ahead.
I can’t keep you here by force and I wouldn’t
try to. Only, you are doing the very thing that
the unknown person wishes you to do. Somebody
is trying to scare us out of this camp and
they haven’t succeeded in doing it yet. Now
you decide that you will go home and admit
defeat to this man who wishes you to clear out.
Not very brave, is it?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about brave!” growled Plum.
“There is only one reason why you don’t want
to give up the encampment and that is because
you are afraid the trustees will say that you
gave it up and they won’t ask you to be big
boss another year!”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of it that way,” smiled
Ted. “Are you thinking of starting for home
tonight?”</p>

<p>“No, but we will the first thing in the morning,”
promised Plum.</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded Ted. “When the daylight
comes if there are any of you who still
think that you want to go home, why, just march
right ahead. The rest of us will finish out our
vacation here in Black Riders’ Camp.”</p>

<p>“You bet we will,” said Bob Gilmore.</p>

<p>“You are welcome to do it,” retorted Plum.
“It is as plain as can be that somebody doesn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
want us around here, so why should we hang
around?”</p>

<p>“Who has a right to chase us out of this
camp?” demanded Buck.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I do know that I won’t
stay here any longer,” said Plum flatly, and he
walked off with his own friends, one of whom
Ted was surprised to note was the small Clayton
boy. He excused the little fellow in his mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he’s pretty young and he’s probably
scared,” he thought.</p>

<p>The rebels hung around the tents talking and
the loyal party stood at somewhat of a loss
near the fire. Buck was inclined to be more
vigorous about it than Ted was.</p>

<p>“That Plum needs a good punch on the
nose!” he declared, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“I guess he’d go home, punch or no punch,”
grinned Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he’d really draw those youngsters
with him just on his own arguments. You
ought to talk to them and try and keep them
here with us.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to wait until morning before I
say anything,” said Ted. “By that time some
of the boys will have experienced a change of
heart. Tonight they are scared and that will
take time to work off. Did he try to win over
all of you fellows?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Charlie. “When you had gone
to examine the rock he told us that the place
was unsafe and that he was sure that some
dangerous spirit was controlling the camp.
Drummer asked him if he believed in ghosts and
he said no, but he wasn’t going to stay in the
camp any longer. He worked on the smaller
fellows by saying that you would never give
up until something serious happened to somebody,
because the club was going to pay you
and Buck something and if you didn’t make the
camp a success you wouldn’t be paid.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is news to us,” Ted smiled to his
chum.</p>

<p>“The same old argument every agitator uses
when he wants to start trouble,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s turn in and forget it until morning,”
advised Ted.</p>

<p>They passed the silent group near the tents
and entered the shelters, proceeding at once to
get undressed. It looked for a moment as though
the ones outside were going to remain up, but
they straggled in at last and went to bed. As
Ted was crawling in the small boy came in and
started to undress.</p>

<p>“I’m not going, Ted,” he said. “I’m going
to stay with you.”</p>

<p>“Good boy!” was Ted’s only comment.</p>

<p>The night was peaceful and in the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
the two bands again formed in groups, the ones
who were going to leave sticking close to Plum
and the others working at the meal as though
nothing had happened. The rebels did their
share but said nothing and they ate in an unbroken
silence.</p>

<p>Besides Tom Clayton there had been another
desertion from the ranks of those who were
leaving. Alfred Paulson refused to go with
Plum and his party. The new section leader
tried to argue him into it.</p>

<p>“No, Ted is the leader of this camp,” said
Alfred, firmly.</p>

<p>“He was the leader of it, you mean!” Plum
said loudly. “Pretty soon he’ll be leading himself
home all alone! Something else will happen
around here and then the rest of the fellows
will come running home, so you might just as
well come now.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to stay right here with Ted!”
said Alfred, stubbornly.</p>

<p>The breakfast was over and the rebels who
were on committees helped to put the camp in
order. When it was over with Plum spoke to
his four young companions and they went
straight to their tents and began to get their
duffle together. The others stood and watched
them in silence for a time.</p>

<p>“Confound it, this breaking up of the camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
will give us somewhat of a black eye!”
grumbled Buck.</p>

<p>“No it won’t.” Ted shook his head. “But
it won’t do this camp site any good.” The ones
who were about to depart were now ready and
they stood around waiting for something. Ted
sauntered over to Plum.</p>

<p>“Going to walk all the way home?” he asked,
as his own friends gathered around.</p>

<p>“Sure! I guess we can do it, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“You can, of course. It is between thirty and
forty miles, and the fellows you are taking with
you aren’t used to any such hikes as that. You
have planned to camp somewhere by the road,
of course? You are going to buy food somewhere,
too, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that,” was the confident reply.
“I have money and we can camp anywhere in
a field. Don’t you worry, Thorn, I will manage.
I don’t do things like you do.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” agreed Ted, softly, his
hands sunk in his pockets.</p>

<p>Plum turned to Ted’s tent, a frown on his
face. “Come on, hurry up!” he cried, angrily,
and to Ted’s surprise Tom Clayton appeared
with his pack on. The little fellow did not look
happy.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Tom?” Ted asked.
“Did you have a change of heart?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“No, but Plum says I better come home,”
replied the boy. “He says if I don’t he’ll tell
my mother and she’ll come up here and take
me home. I don’t like to leave you, but I don’t
want my mother to worry.”</p>

<p>The careless look vanished at once from Ted’s
face and his hands came out of his pockets. He
squared his shoulders as he looked Plum in the
face.</p>

<p>“He won’t go home and tell your mother,
Tom,” the camp leader said, quietly. His tone
changed and hardened as he pointed his finger
at the trouble-maker. “You, Plum, take off
your pack, because I’m going to give you a good
thrashing!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs70">THINGS ARE SETTLED MAN-FASHION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment after Ted made his announcement
there was a complete silence as the boys looked
from one to the other of them. Plum just stared
at Ted, who looked him levelly in the eyes.</p>

<p>“You’re going to what?” demanded Plum,
slowly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to give you a sound thrashing for
being a trouble maker in this camp and for trying
to force Tom to go home with you,” Ted repeated.</p>

<p>His last wish was to stage a fight in front
of the small boys, for he did not wish to set an
example of fighting if he could help it. There
was no physical reason why he should not engage
Plum in combat, because the boy, though
younger, was broader of shoulder and heavier
than he was, but Ted was determined that he
had something definite coming to him for his
actions. He rather hoped that Plum would back
down, so that the smaller boys would not be
treated to an exhibition of a fight between two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
older boys, but he felt warmly that Plum deserved
a trouncing.</p>

<p>But as it so happened, Plum was in no mood
to back down. Eagerly he welcomed the prospect
of a fight and on the previous night he
had purposely pushed Ted rather roughly on the
chest with the sole object of angering him and
starting a fight. He knew now that he would
have to prove himself in the eyes of his friends
and show his leadership. Long ago and more
than once he had looked Ted over with a calculating
eye and the conclusion that he could
“lick” him at any time had been in his mind
for several days. It was with visible joy that
he accepted the invitation for battle.</p>

<p>“You’re going to thrash me, eh?” he sneered,
thrusting forward his chin. “So that’s what
you think you are going to do, is it? Why, if I
couldn’t tie you up in a knot I’d go back home
and join a kindergarten!”</p>

<p>“Join whatever you please, but take your
pack off,” nodded Ted.</p>

<p>The pack was slipped off in a rush and the
coat followed. Ted stood ready and waiting
while Plum rolled up his sleeves. The other
boys crowded around, some of the smaller ones
looking a bit scared. Tom Clayton put in a
last word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“You mustn’t fight on account of me,” he
said, looking distressed.</p>

<p>Before Ted could reply Plum struck in with:
“Don’t worry, we aren’t going to fight over
you, kid. This Thorn has had a trimming coming
to him for a long time and I’m going to
give it to him! He’s been the big boss around
here for some time and he has put it on thick.
Telling us when to go to bed and when to get up
and when to eat and when to do everything,
like he was the king of the country or something!
When we fellows who are going home
do get home we’ll go off on a camping trip of
our own and we’ll do things to suit ourselves.
Get on guard, Thorn!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” cried Buck, who was burning
to take Ted’s place, but who kept quiet with
some difficulty. “This affair has to be run right.
Two minute rounds, and I’m the boss! You
start and finish when I say so!”</p>

<p>Plum dropped his hands to his side. “Say,
this is a fight, not a boxing match! I want to
lick him in a hurry and I don’t want to have
to stop right when I’m going strong.”</p>

<p>“If you want to do it in a hurry, two minutes
ought to be plenty of time,” retorted Buck.
He took out his watch. “Here, all the rest of
you get back and form a big circle. When I say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
time you start and when I say time again, you
stop. Got that clear, Plum?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Let’s get going and stop all the hot
air!”</p>

<p>Buck looked at his watch, and then, “Time!”
he called.</p>

<p>Ted and Plum faced each other grimly,
squared off for the battle.</p>

<p>In his crouching attitude Plum looked bulky
and menacing, while Ted looked cool and alert.
Plum began to advance, his steps cautious and
his fists poised in the attitude of a boxer. He
had taken lessons in the art and was no novice
at it, while Ted had confined his activities to
neighborhood scraps which had been informal
affairs and in which he had been as often beaten
as victorious. But he had no fear of Plum,
who was to be counted on for more in the line
of bluster and noise than for anything else.</p>

<p>They were close now and Ted tried a light
shot which was quickly blocked by the other
boy. Plum then jabbed quickly at the camp
leader with his right, stopped the blow halfway
and landed with his left on the shoulder. That
tap, light as it was, started the fight off in earnest,
for Ted bored in, disregarding a few shots
at close range and the fight was actually on.</p>

<p>Plum knew how to box well and most of the
close-in blows which Ted directed toward him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
were deftly and completely blocked. In return
he shook Ted up, planting his blows almost at
will, though Ted kept his chin covered up. When
Buck called time for the first round they had
just warmed up.</p>

<p>Ted retired to one side of the ring to recover
his breath and Plum walked across to the other.
“How many rounds is this thing going to be?”
Ralph demanded.</p>

<p>“It will go on until one of you admits that
he is licked,” replied Buck. He glanced again
at his watch. “Time is up. Go to it.”</p>

<p>This time Plum was out to win. He rushed
in with his head down and his heavy fists swung
like battering rams. Ted was forced to put
all the strength he had into his footwork, for
Plum was on the march and would not be
denied. He had the weight to keep on coming
and Ted was unable to stop him. There was
no cautious poking this time, but serious rushing
and stepping aside. To keep his feet at all
Ted was forced to move fast.</p>

<p>During this round, busy as he was, Ted saw
that he was making a mistake by allowing Plum
to get the start. With a rushing start and the
power of a heavier body the big boy had everything
his own way and it was impossible for
Ted to do more than keep him off. From his
football playing Ted was fast and nimble, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
he hadn’t gone into the argument just to run
around the ring. Plum must be punished or he
would draw most of the boys away from the
camp and spoil a perfectly good Summer.</p>

<p>When the round was over he thought seriously
of the affair in which he was engaged.
It was no good natured argument that didn’t
matter very much whether he won or not. He
realized that he must win, or the breaking up of
the camp would be a blow from which he would
not recover in a long time. Most of the boys
would desert him and return home with Plum,
he was sure, and the failure would make the
trustees of the club regret their choice of him
as the leader. Boys naturally follow the one
who can lead, even if that leadership is attained
by the use of ready fists, and Plum, swaggering
in the triumph of the physical victory, could
split the camp so as to spoil its effectiveness.
It was imperative that he win the fight before
him, not only for the good of the camp, but for
the effect it would have on the minds of the
boys.</p>

<p>He looked across at Plum and saw that he
was breathing heavily. Plum was not an outdoor
boy in the strictest sense of the word and
he did not play on any athletic team. He was
just naturally strong and he did enjoy boxing,
a subject he knew something about, as a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
sore spots, combined with a split lip, led Ted
to believe. But his wind was not good and his
chest rose and fell in a way that looked painful.</p>

<p>“My best bet is to make him run around
after me this round and then finish him in the
next,” thought Ted, as Buck called time again.</p>

<p>Plum again charged and Ted side-stepped,
leading him a chase around the ring. The boys
had been rather silent the first two rounds but
now, gripped with excitement, they called the
names of their favorites, and Plum’s name was
as prominent as Ted’s. Just as Plum had calculated
his readiness to fight and his swagger
had won the smaller boys to him and they were
loudly shouting for his success.</p>

<p>Ted found difficulty in keeping out of Plum’s
way and his movements annoyed the other.
“Come on, fight, and don’t run away!” roared
Plum. “If you are scared, just quit! I’ve got
you licked, anyway!”</p>

<p>The speech was an unfortunate one, for in
giving it the trouble-maker had raised his head
and carelessly lowered his arms a bit. Most
of the blows so far had been body blows, both
boys keeping their faces well sheltered, but as
Plum spoke Ted jabbed a blow at him which
Plum was unable to guard against. It landed
with a resounding smack against his cheek bone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
and his head jarred. As he hesitated in surprise
Ted hooked one into his ribs.</p>

<p>By this time Plum was on guard again and
stung to fury he waded in while Ted retreated.
Around the ring they went, Plum making a
furious attack which was beginning to break
down Ted’s guard. Just then Buck called time
and Ted stepped back.</p>

<p>Plum turned to Buck, his eyes furious and
his face red. “I don’t care a hang about time!”
he shouted. “I didn’t want to make this a boxing
match, anyway, and I won’t make it one!
I’m going to show Thorn that he can’t boss me
and tell me he’ll thrash me and that’s what
I’m going to do. Come on, you, put up your
hands!”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” snapped Buck, leaping into
the circle and thrusting himself in between
them. “You’re going to run this according to
rules!”</p>

<p>“Like fun I am! You get out of the way or
I’ll take you on!”</p>

<p>“With the greatest of pleasure!” promptly
cried Buck, squaring off.</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon give it to you as to him!”
yelled Plum. This was a well calculated piece
of acting, and the boys who stood for Plum felt
him rise heroically in their eyes.</p>

<p>Ted pushed Buck to one side. “This is my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
fight, Buck, old man. Put your watch away, because
this is a fight to the finish!”</p>

<p>Buck reluctantly allowed himself to be pushed
out of the ring, at the same time pushing his
watch back in his pocket. Then Ted advanced
determinedly on Plum and the latter began a
crouching advance on him. There was now no
more boxing and no more dodging around.
Plum was tired and his breath came heavily,
while Ted was filled with quiet, steady purpose.
He felt that there was but one thing to do, and
that was to wade in and finish up the other boy
as rapidly as possible. When they came together
with a shock there was no more boxing
and feinting, but they stormed in close and exchanged
punches with determination.</p>

<p>Here Ted found that he was equal at least
of the other and they traded some jarring
punches at close range. The breath of the
heavier boy was growing shorter, while Ted
was in no way distressed. With a mighty lunge
Plum shot a stiff punch at Ted’s face, and the
latter, drawing his head to one side, countered
with a sharp one to Plum’s ribs. Plum grunted,
turned, and Ted found his jaw unguarded for
an instant. He found it a moment later with
his left fist, and as Plum staggered Ted bored
in for the finish.</p>

<p>And it was the finish. Fighting blindly, Plum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
gave ground and lost his grip on his guard. In
bewilderment he raised and lowered his hands
and Ted, keenly alive to what was going on,
punished him at will. A left to the jaw and
another right to the cheek sent Plum down in
a heap, while Ted stood panting, waiting for
him to get up.</p>

<p>But Plum was through and he knew it.
Moaning feebly, he felt of his jaw and his face,
which was beginning to swell. Unsteadily he
got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Ready for more?” Ted asked, quietly.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve had enough,” Plum gasped, wiping
a cut lip. “I’m—I’m going home.”</p>

<p>Ted turned to the others around him. “Plum
is going home. Are any of you fellows going
with him?”</p>

<p>There was no reply. They looked from Plum
to Ted but no one spoke. Slowly Plum rolled
down his sleeves, put on his coat and slung
his pack on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Anybody going with me?” he asked, keeping
his eyes away from Ted and Buck.</p>

<p>No one spoke up and the boys who were
ready to go looked foolishly at the ground. Ted
spoke to them sharply.</p>

<p>“This is the last call,” he said. “If any of
you are going with Plum, go now! But if you
don’t go with him, remember that you are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
stay here, subject to the orders of Buck and myself,
and we’re not leaving this spot until Labor
Day unless something happens that we couldn’t
stay to face. So if you want to leave, leave
now.”</p>

<p>Still no one moved and Plum put on his hat,
his air one of sullen defiance. He looked around
him sneeringly.</p>

<p>“All right, you kids just stay here and hang
around Thorn, if you want to!” he said. “But
I’ll fix this camp! I’m going home and tell all
over town what is happening, and I’ll bet your
fathers and mothers will come running for
you.”</p>

<p>“You just go ahead and do that, Plum!” advised
Buck. “When the parents come out here
we’ll show them that we are still in camp and
that you were the only one who got scared and
ran home! You, the biggest boy in the camp,
went home, because you were afraid to stay!”</p>

<p>At once Plum saw his case. He could not
possibly remain in camp after his thrashing
from Ted and if he went back to town and told
any stories the result would be as Buck had
pictured it. He had lost all around and the
knowledge was a bitter one.</p>

<p>He turned and walked out of the camp without
a word or a backward glance.</p>

<p>They stood and watched him go in silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the ring still unbroken. Then first one boy
and then another of the ones who had packed
to go with him, shed his knapsack and blanket,
tossing them in the tents. The atmosphere
seemed to have cleared magically.</p>

<p>“Well, sir!” enthused Buck, slapping Ted
on the back. “That was a bang-up fight! Now
that he is gone things will be a little sweeter
around here. He was the big disturbing
element.”</p>

<p>“Except the fellow who has been annoying
us all this time,” reminded Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so. If we could only get rid
of him as you did of Plum.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can,” said Ted. “I have thought
out a plan to trap that party.”</p>

<span class="fs70">BUCK’S SQUAD TAKES THE FIELD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ted refused at the time to reveal the details
of his plan for trapping the person who was
annoying them in their camp, but he promised
that he would later on. Feeling that a good
part of the morning had been wasted in the
details of his fight with Plum, he preferred that
they get things done around the camp. This
was attended to and then he and Buck had two
important matters to attend to.</p>

<p>The first was that of seeking the tracks of
the horse who had posed on the rock on the
previous evening, with a view to tracing the
animal in the hope of obtaining some clue as
to its owner. They went to the rock and
searched carefully around, moving away from
it with eyes alert to pick up the mark of a
hoof, but the ground around was too rocky to
help them any. Some fifty feet away from it
they found one print but that was all, and they
finally gave it up as a bad job.</p>

<p>“When that fellow brought the horse down
to the rock he made a good job of it,” Ted admitted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
mopping his forehead. “He didn’t mean
that we were to find any hoof prints.”</p>

<p>“But a horse is pretty heavy, and I should
think he would be bound to leave marks,” murmured
Buck.</p>

<p>“Well, there is a way to do everything,” said
Ted, with a grin. “I remember a trick I used
to work on my father. I used to go swimming
over in Tier’s Pond that summer you were away
and the only way to get there without hoofing
it was to take the horse and carriage, because
I was small then and didn’t have the old car.
But I knew if my dad saw the wheel prints and
the hoof prints in the gravel, he’d know I had
taken the carriage and the horse, which he
didn’t want me to take, so I put a couple of
blankets down and walked the horse across
them, then went back and picked up the first
one and put it down ahead of the horse’s hoofs,
and in that way we got out of the drive without
leaving a mark. When I came back at night I
used to spread them out again and get in without
so much as a trace showing. Maybe that
is what our friend of last night did.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t doubt it. He had everything
carefully planned, and we’ll have to hustle some
to catch up with him.”</p>

<p>After lunch the two leaders went to the farmhouse
and there Ted used the telephone to call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Lawyer Calvert. When the president of the
club got on the wire Ted told him the events
of the past few days and narrated his reason
for thrashing Plum. The lawyer listened without
comment until he was finished.</p>

<p>“You did just what was right, Thorn,” he
told Ted. “That boy had it coming to him for
a long time. When he gets in town I’ll see to
it that he doesn’t spread any stories around
among the parents. But are you sure that
everything is all right? You don’t need any
special protection?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, Mr. Calvert,” replied Ted.
“So far we have managed to stand it and I
think that we’ll be able to face it to the end.
I have some plans for setting a trap for the
man, whoever he is, and I think we’ll fix him
so that he’ll stay away. If things should get
serious I would let you know, and if necessary
abandon the camp, but I’m pretty sure that it
won’t come to that.”</p>

<p>“All right, just as you say. You are in complete
charge and I rely on you. If you need
any more money with which to buy provisions,
call me and I’ll see to it that you get it.”</p>

<p>Ted promised to do so and with that the conversation
came to an end. The farmer and his
wife had listened openly to the conversation on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Ted’s part, and they quite frankly let him see
it in their subsequent words.</p>

<p>“Sho, you boys havin’ a little trouble down
to your camp, ain’t you?” the farmer said, as
Ted joined Buck in the kitchen of the house.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ll get at the bottom of it pretty
soon,” affirmed Ted. “By the way, if you
should hear from any one around that they know
anything about it, you might let me know.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sure do that,” promised the farmer.
“Anybody ought to be ashamed to go botherin’
you while you ain’t doing nothing but enjoyin’
yourself campin’.”</p>

<p>“I’d be scared to death to stay down there at
night,” the farmer’s wife shook her head.</p>

<p>The next move on Ted’s part was strange
even to Buck. They went to Montvery and
there Ted bought ten cheap flashlights.</p>

<p>“What is the idea?” Buck demanded. “We
have lanterns in the camp and we don’t really
need flashlights. A few of us have them already
and there is plenty of oil for the lamps.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I want every boy to have a
flashlight. It is part of the plan which I will
unfold when we get back to camp.”</p>

<p>When they arrived at the camp they found
the boys in swimming, with their clothing piled
in plain sight on the bank of Bear Creek. “We
didn’t trust this place,” Drummer confided.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
“We were afraid if we left the clothes in the
tent somebody would walk off with ’em or make
them vanish or something!”</p>

<p>When they were all out and dressed Ted
called them in a knot around him. They stood
away from the tents and the tress, out in the
open space.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you what I have in mind out
here where no one could possibly be listening,”
he began. “So many funny things happen
around here that I’m afraid to talk for fear
that my words will be overheard. What I wanted
to tell you is this: Up until now this pest has
been scaring us and running away, laughing up
his sleeve—if he has a sleeve! We don’t know
enough about him to know how he does dress,
unless he’s a fake Black Rider all the time.
Every time he has bothered us we sit here looking
dazed and let him get away from us. Now,
my idea is this: to create two distinct squads,
a camp squad and a chasing squad. We’ll settle
after awhile who is to be who, but for the
time being we’ll see what each one is to do.”</p>

<p>“This afternoon I bought flashlights for those
who haven’t any and from now on, as soon as
it gets dark, we’ll wear ’em on our belts. Don’t
leave them in your tents for a single minute!
We have lanterns in the tents, but by the time
we get the lanterns lighted and started off, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
would-be terror could get a good start and we’d
never nail him. Because the chasing squad is
to form and run after the man the minute
there is a suspicious sound around the camp!”</p>

<p>There was a stir of expectancy and the boys
looked a bit startled but more pleased than anything
else. Ted went on: “Buck will be the
head of the chasing squad and I’ll take care of
the camp squad. The reason I don’t want every
one to go running out and chasing up the mountain
is because I don’t think the camp should
ever be left alone. The chasing squad will be
composed of the fastest runners, and also the
biggest fellows, just in case you have to use
any force on anyone, though it isn’t likely that
a bunch of boys such as we are could ever
handle a grown man, but if we can get a line on
the direction he runs in we’ll begin to learn
something.”</p>

<p>“You get the point, don’t you? As soon as
there is any unusual noise, Buck’s squad forms
and runs in that direction. The rest of us stay
in camp and guard it against surprise. I’ve
got another thought in regard to trapping a
visitor, but this one will do for now. From
this time on we’ll be doing something besides
sitting still and just listening and looking
scared. Now, lets pick squads.”</p>

<p>The biggest and oldest boys, seven in number,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
were immediately picked for Buck’s squad
and the rest were reserved for the camp watch.
Some of the boys were disappointed because
they couldn’t run with the active group, but
Ted was determined to make his two sections
effective. There was a lot of chattering on the
subject and the leader was compelled to warn
them to keep things quiet.</p>

<p>“Think they will be eager for action when
the time comes?” Buck asked.</p>

<p>“I guess they will. They know that a bunch
of them will be in action and that makes a
difference. I think it will work out.”</p>

<p>The flashlights were passed out and from that
time on the boys carried them on their belts
and longed for action. But two nights sped by
without anything unusual happening and they
began to think that everything was over, when
the third evening brought action suddenly.</p>

<p>They were sitting around the campfire when
there was a sliding sound back of them and a
tiny avalanche of dirt and stones rolled down
behind the tents. There was a crashing noise
as though someone had landed in the bushes,
and then, as they peered in a startled manner
toward the rear of the camp they saw a figure
bolt into the shrubs near the springs.</p>

<p>“There he goes! Go after him!” shouted
Ted, and Buck frantically pulled at his flashlight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
The other boys followed his lead as he
darted off, and in an instant the peaceful camp
was demoralized. The eight boys on the chasing
squad were running across the camp toward
the springs and the others who were to remain
in camp were urging them on at the top of
their lungs.</p>

<p>Drummer joined Buck and they came to the
bottom of the rise, pushing their way up it with
their lights turned on. They could hear the
sound of the running man in front of them, and
it was evident that he had thrown all caution
to the wind in an endeavor to get away from
them. On flat ground Drummer would not have
been able to keep up with his chief, but his
sturdy legs were good for climbing and he was
able to remain pretty close to Buck’s side. Back
of them the other boys ran along, forgetting
nervousness in the excitement of the chase.</p>

<p>The camp lay far behind them now and they
noted that the man was taking a course off in
the direction which Farmer Crane had told
them was the way to Hogs’ Hollow. If this
was the man from that region he would speedily
lose them, for it was evident that he knew the
country and at the first opportunity he would
conceal himself and let them hunt for him at
will. But just now he seemed to be putting all
of his strength and skill into his running. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
had no light and must have been very familiar
with the surrounding country.</p>

<p>He was drawing ahead of them now and the
noise of his running footsteps was growing
dimmer. The country became wilder and rocks
protruded jagged heads above the mountain
soil. The woods had given way to open country
thickly sprinkled with bushes and before they
had run many yards further they came across
a narrow road that was little more than a wagon
track. Drummer and Buck were becoming
winded and the other boys had dropped out
of the swift running, though they were still
advancing.</p>

<p>A stone wall, long and low, loomed up before
them and beyond a set of stones which seemed
more orderly than the ones they had encountered
thus far in their run, attracted their
attention. The flashlights revealed the fact
that they were grave stones and they had arrived
at a little country graveyard. They
stopped to get breath.</p>

<p>“Ow, that was a tough run!” gasped Drummer,
leaning on the wall.</p>

<p>“You bet it was!” agreed Buck, as two other
boys came up. “I think he went across this
graveyard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t hear him,” said Bob, listening intently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>All sounds of the pursued had ceased and the
night was silent except for the murmur of the
voices of the other boys, who now came up and
joined them. Buck and Drummer had made
enough noise in their running to serve as a
permanent guide for the others.</p>

<p>“Maybe he ran right across it and is still
going,” said Charlie, nodding toward the quiet
graveyard.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I’m going in and see if
he is hiding behind a stone,” announced Buck.</p>

<p>His followers looked startled and uneasy and
he noted the look. “You fellows stay here and
I’ll just take a quick look,” he said, stepping
over the wall. “Put your lights out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” declared Drummer, lifting
one foot over the wall.</p>

<p>“No, you stay here with the boys. There
aren’t many stones in the yard and it will only
take me a moment. I’ll be right back, so keep
absolutely quiet.”</p>

<p>With that Buck began his search, looking behind
the stones by the light from his flash. The
graveyard was a little longer than he had been
able to make out from the rays of his light, and
he kept moving away from the boys in the road.
Back of every stone he flashed the light, but
found nothing.</p>

<p>He was now at the far end of the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
cemetery and one large monumental stone alone
remained. He stepped toward it, pressing the
button on the flashlight, for he allowed it to go
out after each flash. As he did so he stepped
around the big stone and instantly sensed the
presence of someone in the darker shadow behind
the shaft.</p>

<p>But before he could step back or press on
his light a strong arm was thrown around him
and a rough, horny hand was clapped over his
mouth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs70">AN UNEASY CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The boys who had remained in the camp
stood watching and listening as the field squad
rushed off on the trail of the man who had
slipped down into their camp. Small as the
boys were, every one of them wished earnestly
that he had been included in the party delegated
to do the active work, and it was with some
envy that they saw their more favored comrades
run out of the circle of light and enter
the black belt of the woods.</p>

<p>But Ted had no intention of allowing them
to stand around and watch. There were things
to do and he knew that action would relieve
them of some of their stored up feelings.</p>

<p>“All right, fellows,” he called to them.
“Let’s get on the job and build big fires. We
don’t know what time the other boys will get
back, and when they do we want to have the
fires going briskly. Get your axes and we’ll
snap to it.”</p>

<p>“There is a pile of wood near the fire now,”
pointed out one boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but that wood is going on right now,”
replied Ted, piling the pieces of cut wood on
the red fires. “We will have to hustle and cut
up a big supply so that Buck and the boys will
have a guide when they come back. Light the
lanterns and we’ll get busy.”</p>

<p>The lanterns were lighted and they plunged
into the fringe of the woods. The sound of
several axes rang out as their owners began
to chop the wood for the fire supply. The lanterns
were placed on the ground and made a
neat ring near them and in the circle of this
ring they chopped off dead limbs and split logs.
As soon as the wood was collected they carried
it back and piled it beside the fires.</p>

<p>Both fires were now going at their best and
the light cast from them lighted up the camp
from all angles. Some of the boys would have
stopped with their first load, but Ted knew that
they might have to wait a long time before their
companions returned, so he kept them at the
task. The pile grew and grew until it towered
above their heads, and in this way fully an
hour went by. At last Ted felt that they had
enough.</p>

<p>“All right, that will be enough,” he called.</p>

<p>The work was not yet all over, for the wood
which had been dragged in required to be split
into convenient lengths, although some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
big logs were piled on entire. While the work
went on they kept looking up toward the mountain,
but no sound reached them and they speculated
on the fact.</p>

<p>“They must have had to run a long way,”
said Alfred, as he split wood.</p>

<p>“I guess they went clear over the mountain,”
nodded Ted. “It may be that they are trailing
the man.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose that anyone has hurt
them, do you?” another boy asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” smiled Ted. “One man,
no matter how strong he is, would have a big
job in front of him if he tried to run off with
that bunch of fellows. I guess they’ll be back
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>But the time dragged on and the boys became
silent, glancing restlessly up the mountain side.
Ted, looking at his watch, saw that it was eleven
o’clock.</p>

<p>“A good two hours since they went away,”
he thought, somewhat anxiously. “Oh, well,
I suppose time seems longer when you are waiting
for something than it does if you aren’t.
If we only knew what was going on we’d feel
better.”</p>

<p>He tried to keep the conversation brisk but
the boys would not react. They were visibly
oppressed, and they showed in their dogged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
silence that they were uneasy. Although none
of them believed for a moment in anything
ghostly, they found the vague stories of the
camp a distinct hindrance to their peace of
mind and the feeling of depression was heavy
upon all of them. Ted wondered if there was
not something that they might do to ward off
the feelings which gripped them off, and he
was thinking busily along this line when a
sound reached their ears.</p>

<p>It was a low-pitched moaning and it seemed
to come from a point above their camp, in the
pine thicket which covered the knoll there.</p>

<p>They looked in the direction of the sound,
their blood chilling under its influence. It was
weird and mournful, and the icy shivers ran
up and down the spine of more than one of the
young boys. Ted was not in a comfortable
state of mind himself, but he knew that something
had to be done about it. He leaped to his
feet.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’ve got to see if anyone is hurt
up there!” he called, reaching for his lantern.
The other boys followed him closely and he
passed around the tents and ran rapidly up
the incline toward the pine clump. The groaning
had ceased as soon as they had started for
the place from which the disturbing sounds had
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>They arrived in the grove in a group, the
lanterns flashing generous beams around them,
but there was no one to be seen. Thinking that
someone might be concealed in the bushes they
thrust their lights in there and looked closely,
but there was no sign of a living person, and
as only a living being could produce the sound
which had startled them so profoundly, they
half expected to see someone who had been injured
in some manner. But although they
searched the grove they could not find a trace
of anyone.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” commented Ted, now more
annoyed than frightened. “The groans came
from here, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Sure they did,” was the ready response.</p>

<p>“Well, the groaner has moved somewhere
else,” said Ted, half angry and half jokingly.
“We won’t even be able to find any footprints,
because there is such a carpet of pine needles
that a print wouldn’t show. Confound this
whole business, I——”</p>

<p>From across the camp, and on the other side
of Bear Creek, came the groaning sound again.
The boys stirred and looked anxiously at Ted.</p>

<p>The hot blood surged into his face and he
would have liked nothing better than to have
come to instant physical encounter with the
groaner. While he waited to control his hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
anger the groans came in long drawn out wails
that, under the circumstances, chilled their
blood. Besides being angry Ted was also
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Buck and his squad chased that fellow up
the mountain,” he said aloud. “I wonder if
he could have slipped around them and come
back? Maybe he just wanted to lead them off
on a chase.” Abruptly he turned to the boys.
“Come on back to the camp.”</p>

<p>They followed him in silence back to the camp
and as soon as they entered the circle of light
cast by the fires the groaning ceased. A weighty
silence succeeded.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” Ted addressed them, in a low
tone. “There isn’t any use of us running all
around trying to find out who this practical
joker is. He’ll just run us ragged, so let’s
retire into the center tent and stay there until
Buck and his squad gets back. We can watch
everything that goes on from the flap of the
tent and by keeping under cover we’ll make
the chap who is so fond of tricks either show
himself or shut up!”</p>

<p>They all crowded under the canvas of the
second tent, glad for the shelter, frail as it was.
From their position some of the boys could
look out and watch the other tents and all of
them could watch the fire. Ted did not go into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
the tent at once, but took a lantern and made
sure that his flashlight was at his side.</p>

<p>“You fellows stay here and keep a sharp
lookout,” he directed. “I’m going down to see
if there is any way for anyone to cross the
creek.”</p>

<p>“Going all by yourself?” a boy asked, his
eyes staring in awe.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ll be right back,” nodded Ted.
“See you later.”</p>

<p>He walked off, leaving them to chatter in a
hushed way among themselves, and going at
once to the creek, took his course along it and
away from the camp. He knew that there was
a shaky old wood bridge down the creek at
some yards from the camp, and while he had
told the boys that he was going only that far,
Ted secretly determined to cross and have a
look at the rather marshy ground on the other
side of the curving stream. He was almost certain
that he would find nothing, but he wanted
to look nevertheless.</p>

<p>“But I mustn’t allow anything to happen to
me,” he thought, anxiously. “These boys
would be leaderless at least until Buck got back,
and there is no telling what might happen to
them. I mustn’t be gone long, either.”</p>

<p>He came to the bridge, which he had found
one day in his wanderings, and he crossed it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
his footsteps sounding hollow and damp as his
shoes pressed the rotted boards. On the other
side he stepped ashore into a slippery species
of soil that gently oozed water as his foot
struck and sank slightly into it. The bushes
here were thick and he was compelled to force
his way through them. Before going beyond
the bridge he lowered his lantern and looked at
the soft earth and at once perceived something
which excited his closest attention.</p>

<p>There was the imprint in the dirt of a large
shoe.</p>

<p>The shoe was evidently a good one and
showed no sign of wear, while the heel of it was
quite new and left impressions which proclaimed
it to be a rubber one with regulation
holes and a trade mark which was too faint to
be of more than passing value to him. But the
sight of the print alone caused him to rejoice
that at last there was a clear record.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll just see where this print leads to,”
he thought and started off. A moment later
he halted as another thought came to him.</p>

<p>“The prints don’t return. Suppose the man
is hiding in the bushes, just waiting for me!”</p>

<p>The reflection made his skin creep and for
a moment he fought a growing desire to turn
and go back. But after an instant of indecision
he fought it off. “I’ll have to chance it and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
on. I won’t go far from camp, and if I do see
anyone, I can fight it out or run like a streak.
I won’t cross the bridge, either, I’ll cut right
across the ground and jump into the creek and
swim it. Don’t know if I’m foolish or not, but
here goes!”</p>

<p>With every sense on the alert he walked forward,
eyes straining, ears pitched for a sound,
ready to retreat at a moment’s notice. It was
no easy task to follow the footprints and look
around him at the same time, but he managed
to do it as he advanced. At a point opposite
the camp he came to a complete halt and marked
the spot where the man had evidently stood
when he delivered the groans, for there the soft
ground was foot-printed lavishly. From that
spot the man had gone off down the stream
away from the camp until he had come to the
creek at a point where rocks protruded so far
above the stream that he had found it easy to
walk across and take to the woods alongside of
the camp. Ted noted that the ford was out of
sight of the tents and while they were going into
the tents the man had evidently crossed the
low part of the stream and had entered the
woods at a point not far from where Buck and
his squad had entered it.</p>

<p>“After he finished his groaning he must have
decided that he had scared us enough,” mused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Ted, as he stood there peering around. “Confound
him, if I ever get my hands on him, I’ll
knock his head off, provided I’m big enough!
What anyone should take all the trouble to try
and scare a bunch of fellows out of camp for
is more than I can figure out!”</p>

<p>He crossed the stream at the point where the
mysterious man had crossed and made his way
back toward the camp, coming up alongside of
the fires, in plain sight of the anxiously waiting
boys. They were greatly astonished to see him
come from the opposite direction from that in
which he had started.</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to call out a cheery
greeting to them and then his mouth remained
open, no sound issuing from it for the moment.
In the pine grove above them he detected a
spurt of fire, and the next instant a dry bush
burst into crackling flame. He awoke from his
temporary muteness.</p>

<p>“Come on boys, on the jump!” he shouted.
“Grab all the pails you can get hold of! The
woods are on fire!”</p>

<span class="fs70">DRUMMER SAVES HIS CHIEF</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was with a sinking heart and a quick flash
of chilling fear that Buck felt himself in the
grasp of the unknown man back of the cemetery
monument. The attack had come so quickly
that, added to the mystery and uncanniness of
the place and hour, his mind whirled for the
moment. The hand over his mouth was rough
and horny, calloused apparently by hard labor,
and the arm which encircled his body and
pinned his own arms to his sides was a strong
and sinewy one, the thin but whip-like cords of
which he could feel even through his clothing.</p>

<p>His fingers still rested on the button of his
flashlight and the thought occurred to him to
light it. But as though reading his thought
the strange individual swung down a long, lean
hand and swept it from his grasp. Buck might
have used his light for a weapon had he thought
about it, but just now his thoughts and impressions
were too confused to allow for anything
constructive.</p>

<p>Still keeping his hand over Buck’s mouth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
his thin arm around his body with a grip of
steel, the man peered out around the tall stone
to see if anyone was following the leader. He
could see the group of boys merely as shadows
a little darker than the sky, for at the point
where they were standing there was no woods
background and as the cemetery was high on
a ridge of the mountain the boys were outlined
like uneasy shadows against a black sky. Seeming
to derive comfort from the fact that Buck
was all alone, the man started to drag him off.</p>

<p>But in this period of time Buck had recovered
his presence of mind. The man who had him
was very little taller than he was, his body
was thin and he seemed to be nearer middle
age than young. All in all, Buck was huskier,
but for all that, the man who held him had
muscles of steel. There was no doubt that he
was a native mountain character and he was
ready for any emergency. Buck wished fervently
that he could get his mouth free and
also gain the use of his arms. He felt that with
the use of his arms he could match himself up
favorably with the man who held him.</p>

<p>Just as the man began to drag him off, Buck
began a frantic attempt to break away. He
jerked his head back in an effort to free his
mouth, but the man immediately dug his long
fingers into Buck’s cheeks. The pain infuriated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the boy and he increased his struggles. He
fought to free his arms, exerting all of his
strength to do so.</p>

<p>The attempt was futile. Like a winding whip
the thin arm tightened even more closely until
the wind was almost forced from his body.
Then Buck began a foot attack.</p>

<p>This nearly succeeded, for the man was not
prepared for it. Buck gave his nearest foot a
kick that made the man grunt with pain, and
for a moment it looked as though he was going
to go over. But he recovered his ground and
once more began his dragging process. Fighting
stoutly but vainly, Buck was dragged along.</p>

<p>They moved away from the big stone toward
the far wall, the captor finding his progress a
hard one, due to the energetic squirming of
Buck. The boy expected a fierce warning any
minute from the man and perhaps a blow to
silence him, but the mountaineer was depending
on his strength alone to carry Buck off and
not so much as a single word came from him.
Half dragging and half carrying Buck, he made
his way to the wall furtherest away from the
boys. The grass in the cemetery was soft and
wet and Buck’s fighting progress made no
sound.</p>

<p>They arrived at last at the wall and the man
heaved Buck up and over like a sack of wheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
and jumped with him over the low barrier.
They were in the open field, with a few apple
trees around and the deep woods a few scant
yards away. Toward this dense wall of the
thicker trees the determined man began to drag
Buck, who by this time had succeeded in prying
open his fingers so as to breathe between them.</p>

<p>Something unexpected happened. There was
a swish near them which puzzled them both.
The captor stopped in some bewilderment and
then something hard struck him on the side of
the temple, causing him to grunt and hesitate
in his progress.</p>

<p>Back at the wall the boys had watched Buck’s
progress as he went from stone to stone with
his flashlight and they had remained quiet while
he had worked his way deeper and deeper into
the quiet graveyard. Drummer felt somewhat
grieved that his leader had not taken him along
but he kept the fact to himself. Buck’s light
was seen once far down in the cemetery, close
to a towering monument, and it was seen no
more. Time dragged on heavily.</p>

<p>Impatiently, the boys waited at the wall,
standing close together in the darkness. The
quietness of the lonely country, the association
of the graveyard and the uncertainty of the
whole enterprise made them want to give up
the affair and return to the camp. They thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
somewhat wistfully of the warm campfires and
their friends below, and they were anxious to
get back. Before long they became restless
and nervous.</p>

<p>“Confound it, wish he’d come back!”
grumbled a boy.</p>

<p>“He’ll be right back,” reassured Drummer,
secretly uneasy.</p>

<p>For the past few seconds Drummer had been
smelling something that appealed to him. There
must be an apple orchard nearby he decided,
and where there was an orchard there must
surely be apples. That particular brand of
fruit was a great favorite with the stout boy,
and after peering around for a moment or two
he decided that the orchard must be at the end
of the graveyard wall. He began to edge off in
that direction.</p>

<p>“Where you going?” Bob whispered.</p>

<p>“To see if I can pick up an apple,” was
the answer, as Drummer moved off.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances no one else was interested
in apples and Drummer went alone.
At the end of the wall he instinctively reached
for his flashlight which he had hung on his belt,
and then he realized that he could not use it.</p>

<p>“Better not,” he decided. “I might give our
position away, and Buck would be mad. I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
hunt around in the dark and I guess I can find
some on the ground.”</p>

<p>The apple trees were now before him and he
stopped under the first tree, looking up. There
were apples on the tree he was able to make
out, but all of them were beyond his reach.
He had no intention of climbing the tree at that
time, though he made up his mind to visit the
old orchard at some later time and help himself
to the apples on the tree.</p>

<p>He reached down, wishing for the added help
of his light but deeming it prudent not to employ
it. There were apples on the ground and
his groping fingers found four of them without
any trouble. There were others nearby, but
he straightened up with a big one in his hand
and carefully felt along the surface of it.</p>

<p>“Got to be careful about eating them in the
dark,” he reflected. “Don’t want to go eating
any worms! This one feels all right.”</p>

<p>He raised his head, and against the break
between the woods and the sky, saw something
that for the moment chilled his blood.</p>

<p>A man who looked for the moment like a goblin
or some horrible creature from another
world, was apparently half-carrying and half-dragging
a big sack of meal after him as he
crept toward the woods. But the sack struggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and moved and in that instant Drummer’s eyes
were opened fully.</p>

<p>He remembered the last flash of Buck’s flashlight
and the long silence from the graveyard.
It was plain at once that the man they had
been chasing was carrying off his chief and for
a brief second the stout boy was on the verge
of yelling at the top of his lungs. One hand
dropped toward his flashlight and then he remembered
the apple in his hand. It was hard
and Drummer was a fairly good shot.</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement, he threw it
toward the two figures before him. It went
wide of the mark, it seemed to the boy and he
stooped down and hastily gathered up the
apples at his feet. Calming down somewhat,
he began to throw them with more care, and
a grunt told him that his second apple had
struck someone. He hoped it had not hit Buck,
but he kept on hurling apples.</p>

<p>There was a fierce struggle before him and
just as his fingers closed over his flashlight, his
last apple having been exhausted, he heard
Buck’s voice.</p>

<p>“He got away!”</p>

<p>Drummer snapped on his flashlight and in
the beams of it he saw the man running across
the orchard toward the woods. Buck was three
or four yards behind him, but the man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
increasing his speed at every stride and it
looked hopeless. Drummer joined in the chase.</p>

<p>When the apple had struck the man on the
head he had hesitated, bewildered, and in that
instant Buck renewed his passionate attempt
to break loose. This time he succeeded in freeing
his mouth and one arm, which he attempted
to wind around the man who had for so long
held him a captive. Two more apples swished
past them at top speed and the man now
changed his tactics. He no longer desired to
hold Buck, but seemed more than anxious to
get away. He loosed his hold on Buck and
wrestled with him in a short, fierce match,
finally breaking Buck’s hold and turning to flee.
The last apple hurled by Drummer struck the
man in the back and he made off like a flash
toward the woods. It was then that Buck
shouted and took up the chase, somewhat
winded from his recent battle.</p>

<p>The man gained the woods well ahead of
him and wound his way in and out among the
trees, too anxious to get away to slow up for
a lack of light. Buck had no light and Drummer’s
flashlight was too far back of him to
be of any use. He could hear the boys chattering
as they took up the chase, but on the edge
of the woods Buck halted, realizing the futility
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>He was winded and dissatisfied and the man
who had plunged into the woods knew them
so well that to follow him would be a pure
waste of time. Drummer caught up with him,
puffing with the exertion and excitement.</p>

<p>“Go-going to chase him?” panted the hero
of the apple bombardment.</p>

<p>“No use,” declared Buck, as the others came
up, lights all turned on. “We’d never get him
in these woods. He knows them too well. You
can’t even hear him, now.”</p>

<p>They stood there listening, but nothing but
unbroken silence came from the depths of the
forest. The rest of the boys did not desire to
press the matter if Buck did not, and they stood
there for some time, listening with awe to
Buck’s story of his adventure. Many were the
exclamations that followed it.</p>

<p>“Boy, you certainly did me a service when
you began to peg those apples!” Buck told
Drummer, laughing. “That artillery fire halted
his advance and gave me my turn at the game.
You certainly used your head!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just once when my appetite
came in handy,” grinned the fat boy.</p>

<p>“It surely did! Next time anyone comes
around bothering the camp we’ll just send you
out with a basket of apples and we can sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
in peace all night! Well, come on back to the
graveyard, I want to get my flashlight.”</p>

<p>They all climbed over the low wall and went
back to the spot where Buck had been captured
by the man behind the monument and there on
the ground they found his flashlight. Beside
it, resting against the base of the stone, they
found a battered lantern.</p>

<p>“I wondered what had become of his lantern,”
said Buck, picking up the battered object.
“Just an ordinary old farm lantern,
which doesn’t tell us much, but we’ll take it
back to camp with us.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be sorry to get back to camp,” said
Charlie.</p>

<p>“Pretty soft for the fellows in camp!” remarked
Drummer. “Just sitting around the
fires waiting for us!”</p>

<p>“Let’s get back to the camp,” suggested
Buck. “They’ll be waiting up for us and worrying.”</p>

<p>In a body they set out for the camp, feeling
better now that everything had turned out well,
although they were sorry that the man had
gotten away. “If we had gotten him we would
have solved the problem of our camp,” said
Buck. “But we’ll keep after him until we do
get him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Think he’ll come around the camp any
more?” Drummer asked.</p>

<p>“Not for a while, anyway. I can’t say
whether he’ll come around again or not because
I don’t know what his object can be. But if
he doesn’t, we’ll go out and hunt him up, because
it is high time that he was brought
down.”</p>

<p>They had run further away from the camp
than they had thought and it took them a long
time to reach the top of the mountain where
they could look down on the camp. The two
fires were burning brightly but no one was in
sight. This puzzled them and they halted,
studying the situation.</p>

<p>“Funny, I wonder where they are?” muttered
Buck.</p>

<p>“Look, somebody crossing the brook with a
lantern!” cried Bob, pointing.</p>

<p>They saw a lone figure crossing the stones
of the brook below the spot where the creek
was deep enough to swim and Buck was sure
that the figure was Ted. They were so high
up and far away that they were unable to tell
accurately, but it looked to be the figure of the
camp leader. He entered the circle of light near
the fire, the lantern swinging by his side.</p>

<p>Then something else claimed the attention of
the boys on top of the mountain. A flicker of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
light came to them from the top of the ridge
back of the springs and then a bush flamed.
They saw the camp boys come running out
of their tents and look toward the fire, then
scurry off toward the truck at the edge of the
camp.</p>

<p>Buck wasted no more time. “Come on, fellows!”
he called, as he started off. “The woods
are burning! We’ve got to help the camp
squad!”</p>

<span class="fs70">A VISIT TO HOGS’ HOLLOW</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The words which Ted shouted to the boys in
the tent struck them dumb for a moment, but to
their ears was borne the sound of the snapping
and crackling. They rushed out of the tent into
the open space of the camp, to see the dry pine
grove above them glowing with fire.</p>

<p>Ted was running toward the truck for pails
and the boys, awakening to the seriousness of
the situation, followed him. Some of them
made a hurried trip to the cooking supplies
which were piled near the fireplaces, snatching
up the pots and pans. Ted pulled out all of the
pails which were in the truck and handed them
around as fast as possible.</p>

<p>“Get water from the spring and go to it!” he
cried, passing out the last pail. Then, seizing
one which he had reserved for himself, Ted ran
up the slope, stopped at the spring to dip out
a supply of water, and then went on to the
thicket where the fire blazed.</p>

<p>The pine grove had been a dry place with an
accumulation of dry leaves and dead bushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
and the whole thicket was now a raging furnace.
The month had been dry and except for
the big storm which had so thoroughly soaked
them the boys had not experienced any adverse
weather. The woods, as a consequence, was in
a receptive mood for a fire, and Ted’s heart
misgave him as he saw the blaze before him.</p>

<p>“If this gets going full blast in the woods,
people will say that we started it, and there
will be the dickens to pay!” he groaned inwardly,
as he threw the water from his pail
onto the fire. “Oh, I do wish that Buck and
his squad was here to help us!”</p>

<p>Boys who had not been able to supply themselves
with pails had seized anything handy
with which to beat at the edges of the fire and
they fought stoutly to beat it to submission.
The smoke was choking and the heat thrown
off was blistering. Ted, having emptied his
pail, raced down to the spring, to find another
problem confronting them.</p>

<p>The two springs had been drained down to
mere trickles. A half dozen pails of water from
each had effectively emptied them and Ted did
not dare wait for the basins to fill up. There
was but one thing to do.</p>

<p>“Fill your pails at the creek!” he cried,
and dashed off down the slope to Bear Creek.
Here he dipped his bucket into the black water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
and ran back up the hill with it, splashing it
on the fire.</p>

<p>“Good glory, we’ll never beat it at this rate,
and we simply have to!” was his despairing
thought.</p>

<p>He remembered the large extra piece of canvas
in the truck, and abandoning his pail he
ran down the hill and procured the material.
Just as he was about to charge back up the
slope there was heard the sound of running
footsteps and Buck’s squad, nearly played out
from their hurried descent, arrived in the camp.</p>

<p>“Buck!” shouted Ted, joyously. “You just
got here in time!”</p>

<p>“I guess so!” was the panted reply. “Here,
let me have an end of that canvas and we’ll try
and smother some of the fire.”</p>

<p>The boys who had just arrived in camp procured
flat pans, shovels and anything else that
came to hand and joined the almost exhausted
boys at the pine grove. Ted and Buck carried
the canvas up and each of them took an end.
This large section of material, when raised and
lowered by the two boys, snuffed out long,
ragged edges of flame, and by working busily
they soon had the fire under control. But their
work was by no means ended as yet. There
were dozens of individual spurts of fire still to
be put out and to these they gave their attention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Two dead trees were beginning to blaze
and the two camp leaders quickly put them out,
so that the fire would not be noted by anyone
living nearby. At the present time they desired
no publicity.</p>

<p>The last glimmer of fire had been put out and
the smoked and blackened boys stood silent for
a moment, panting heavily. The night had been
indeed a strenuous one, and the chasing squad
in particular was worn out completely. Their
long dash after the mountain man, their speedy
return, and the exertions around the pine grove,
had been as much as they could bear. Some of
the smaller boys were shaking decidedly, now
that danger was over, but the trembling was
the result of excitement and exhaustion.</p>

<p>“Me for the spring!” exclaimed Drummer,
and a rush was immediately made for the cool,
fresh water. The basins had not yet filled but
there was enough for everybody and they drank
and drank and drank.</p>

<p>“How’d that patch of pine get on fire?”
Buck asked Ted, waiting for all of the smaller
boys to quench their thirst before caring for
his own parched throat.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” Ted shook his
head. “But it was deliberately fired!”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was Ted’s reply. “But we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
have been annoyed by some one groaning
around all the time you were gone!”</p>

<p>“I can’t figure that,” said Buck. “We chased
our man, and he captured me for about five
minutes. If you say that you were bothered,
then there is more than one prowler.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get our drinks and then swap stories
down at the fire,” suggested Ted, dipping a
tin cup into the cool spring water as Buck did
the same.</p>

<p>Gathering around the fire with fire-fighting
implements still in their hands they looked like
a band of Black Riders themselves, for their
clothing had become burned and their hands
and faces were black. Buck related his adventures
and then Ted told of the groans and his
search across the brook.</p>

<p>“Well, all I can see is that there are two of
these fellows,” declared Buck, when Ted had
finished his story. “I’m beginning to wonder
if that one fellow didn’t purposely lead us a
merry chase just so that his companion could
fire the woods. You know, if the woods had
burned, the authorities around here would be
hot against us for having done it.”</p>

<p>“I know that well enough,” nodded Ted.
“That’s why I just knew that we had to get
that fire out. I guess that things have become
so serious that we’ll have to get in touch with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Mr. Calvert and have some real action taken.
Next thing we know somebody will be getting
hurt or kidnapped or something. Yes, it looks
as though there are two of these fellows.”</p>

<p>“I think that one of them is that Jerry Jackson,
from Hogs’ Hollow,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p>“The fellow that we chased ran in that direction
and I’m sure that he is the one. I suppose
he has a companion and they work together.
Tell you what let’s do, let’s go over
to Hogs’ Hollow tomorrow and call on Mr.
Jackson.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll do it,” agreed Ted. “For
some reason he doesn’t want us to camp here,
and if we find him at home we’ll try and learn
why he doesn’t want us.”</p>

<p>The boys were shaky with fatigue and Ted
ordered them to bed at once, while he and Buck
took lanterns and looked once more over the
ground which had been burned, hoping to find
some kind of a clue. But they were unable to
learn anything from the burned, down-trodden
soil.</p>

<p>“Nothing to be learned here,” decided Ted,
as they went back to camp. “We’ll see what
we can find out at Hogs’ Hollow tomorrow.”</p>

<p>That night the boys slept like logs, and had
anyone been minded to run away with the tents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
trucks or fires themselves, no one would have
known anything about it until daybreak at least,
and most of them not until much later in the
day. It was almost noontime before the whole
camp was awake and crowding around for
something to eat.</p>

<p>“If anyone had run away with the whole
camp last night, I wouldn’t have known it,”
smiled Ted.</p>

<p>“Shows what a bum general he is,” said Buck.
“He should have known that we would all be
half-dead and that he could have worked anything
he wanted to while we slept so soundly.
But we’re glad he is a bum general!”</p>

<p>As soon as camp was cleaned up they began
to make plans for a visit to Hogs’ Hollow. It
was finally decided that only Ted and Buck
would go, and that all of the boys would remain
behind to protect the camp. With Charlie, Bob
and Drummer to counsel and lead the younger
boys they felt reasonably safe, and after talking
it over with those who were to remain in the
camp the two older boys started off.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure that nothing will happen
in broad daylight,” was Ted’s final word to
them.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” Bob had smiled. “We’ve got
Drummer with us, and even if we haven’t any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
apples for him, to peg, maybe he can use potatoes
just as well!”</p>

<p>Walking swiftly and heading in the general
direction which Farmer Crane had told them
to take toward Hogs’ Hollow, they quickly
covered the ground followed last night by
Buck’s squad and arrived at the cemetery.
Passing around the walls of the country graveyard
they entered the woods at a point close to
where the man had escaped on the previous
night and at once found themselves in a tangle
of forest much denser and wilder than that
which surrounded their own camp. The graveyard
itself was on the top of the mountain and
as soon as they entered the dark and cool woods
they began to go down into a valley.</p>

<p>“Notice how the soil gets soft as soon as we
begin to go down?” asked Buck.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I suppose the bottom of the valley
is quite marshy. I guess that is why they call
it Hogs’ Hollow.”</p>

<p>Ted’s guess was a correct one. At the bottom
of the valley they struck a low, marshy
expanse of ground that kept them busy avoiding
muck holes. Tall bunches of weeds and
marsh grass grew in profusion and there was
a decidedly damp smell in the air.</p>

<p>“Cheerful place!” grunted Buck.</p>

<p>“Yes, not! This must be Hogs’ Hollow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Only the animal for whom it is named would
enjoy this place. Now, all we have to do is
to find the shack that this man Jackson lives
in.”</p>

<p>This was not an easy thing to do, for the
hollow was blanketed and screened by so many
bushes and clumps of small trees that they could
not see far before them. They had spent a good
three-quarters of an hour wandering around
when Ted sighted the object of their search
before him on a higher strip of ground.</p>

<p>“There it is! There’s the shack we’re looking
for!”</p>

<p>A rude hut, constructed of picked-up boards
and roofed with sections of tree bark, loomed
up before them on a tongue of land which was
slightly drier than the surrounding territory.
The hut was a large and rambling affair, with
a window on each side and a door which sagged
on leather hinges. A rusted stove pipe thrust
its way up through the bark roof, but no smoke
came from it. There was no sign of life around
the place and they debated the wisdom of walking
boldly up to it.</p>

<p>“We might as well,” decided Ted. “We’re
here to have a talk with this Jerry Jackson and
we might as well plunge right into it. No use
sneaking around, because we have to make the
break sometime or other.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>So they approached the hut openly, eyes and
ears alert for anything unexpected, but there
was no sign or movement of any kind. Ted
peered into a window and found that the place
was empty.</p>

<p>“He isn’t at home,” he said. “Let’s see if
we can’t get in.”</p>

<p>The sagging front door was unlocked and
with some degree of caution the two boys entered
the place, but it was indeed empty of life
and they looked around them with interest. The
furnishings of the hut were as rude as the outside
and they consisted of a discolored table,
a rickety-looking rocking chair and a firmer-looking
straight one, a rusted stove, a disordered
bunk, and various odds and ends. But
the object on the table caught and held their
eyes and they examined it closely.</p>

<p>It was a long white cloth garment which
the dweller in Hogs’ Hollow was working upon,
for a needle still stuck into the cloth and a spool
of white thread stood beside it. There was a
hood to the thing and a cloth mask for the
face, a mask which was punctured with eye
holes and a slit where the mouth should be. The
two boys looked at it silently and then exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>“A ghost suit, as sure as you are a foot
high!” Buck voiced the thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="fs70">THE WATCHING POST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ted nodded as he looked the suit over. It
was a coarse white sheet and the dweller in the
hut was taking some pains on the construction
of it. But there was no doubt as to its proposed
use.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it’s a ghost uniform, if there is
such a thing!” smiled Ted. “And I guess I
have an idea where he intends to wear it!”</p>

<p>“He isn’t going to a masquerade, I’ll bet
on that!” grinned Buck. “If I’m not mistaken
he’ll turn up pretty soon at our camp with this
nightgown on!”</p>

<p>“When he does, we’ll take it off!” promised
Ted, grimly.</p>

<p>“Shall we wait for him to come home and
then nab him?” Buck asked.</p>

<p>“No the sight of this ghost costume has made
me change my mind, and if you agree to my
plan, we’ll work this thing out another way.
Let’s get out of here before he returns and wait
around camp until he does show up in this sheet
affair. Then, when we grab him, we’ll have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
him just where we want him. If we accuse
him of anything now he can easily back out by
saying that he doesn’t know anything about it,
but if we catch him around the camp in this
suit we will have him just where he’ll find it
impossible to escape.”</p>

<p>“That is all right as far as it goes, but how
are we going to know just what night he does
visit the camp? We don’t want a chase such
as we had the other night.”</p>

<p>“No, but I have a plan for a trap. However,
let’s get out of here first and we’ll discuss it
on the way back. Now I’m particularly anxious
that he doesn’t catch us in here or know that
we have been here.”</p>

<p>“All right. We haven’t disturbed anything,
have we?”</p>

<p>Ted looked around thoughtfully and then
shook his head. “I guess not. We didn’t
touch anything and I’m glad we didn’t even
touch the suit. By the way, while we are here,
let’s see if there is any sign of that skeleton that
was in the bushes back of the camp.”</p>

<p>They hunted hastily around for the skeleton,
looking in every corner and into a small closet
space off of the main room, but there was no
sign of the object which had so startled them.
Satisfied that they could not find anything,
which would add to their store of knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
concerning the man, and anxious to get out of
Hogs’ Hollow as soon as possible, they left the
hut, arranging the door as they had found it,
and struck at once off into the swampland
toward the higher ground. No words were exchanged
between them until they had quitted
the hollow and had arrived at higher ground,
where they started off side by side toward the
camp.</p>

<p>“What is your idea about trapping the fellow
when he comes ghosting?” asked Buck, as
they skirted the cemetery and started along the
rough road.</p>

<p>“Now that we have a fairly good idea that
he’ll visit us, we’ll prepare for him,” explained
Ted. “I guess that after the surprise attack
on him the other night he won’t come any too
near the camp in his white sheet, though he
must be going to show himself, or why bother
with a sheet at all? He may plan to reveal
himself on a rock as he did with the black horse
that time, but whichever way he plans it, I
guess we can be sure that he is coming sooner
or later. Now, if we’re going to be in the camp
we won’t have much chance to cope with him,
but we won’t be in camp!”</p>

<p>“Won’t be in the camp!” Buck echoed.
“Where will we be?”</p>

<p>“We’ll be outside of camp and hidden in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
clump of bushes, watching the camp to see what
happens. You know our tents back up against
the hill where the springs are and that will be
an advantage. My idea is for us to lift the
backs of the tents, creep out and along the
slope until we reach that bunch of maples on
the east side of the camp. Those trees are
pretty close together and there is a fine screen
of bushes, where we can lie in wait and watch
the camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Then if he gets to fooling around
back of the camp we can see him better than
we could if we were down in the camp.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and not only that, but I think the sight
of an empty camp will lure him on. If he has
no evil intentions toward the camp I think that
sheer curiosity will draw him into it. Then,
from our watching post on the hill we can figure
out a plan to swoop down on him and surround
him. How does that sound to you?”</p>

<p>“All right,” approved Buck, enthusiastically.
“But we’ll have to be regular Indians to crawl
from the tents to the maples!”</p>

<p>“That is all right, we’ll be able to do it. Of
course, if he ever sees us at it, everything is
over, but we’ll just have to be so careful that
he won’t see us. If anyone is to do the seeing,
we’re the ones to do it. I’d like to catch him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
red-handed prowling around the camp and then
we’ll have a clear case against him.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But don’t forget that he must have a
helper. Things have happened in such a way
that he can’t possibly be doing them all by
himself.”</p>

<p>“I realize that, and I don’t know whether
they’ll work in pairs or not, but I think if we
can get him we’ll have no trouble in getting his
friend, whoever he is. We’ll concentrate on
getting him and that will probably clear up the
atmosphere quite a bit.”</p>

<p>They arrived at the camp, to find the other
boys anxiously awaiting them, though they had
not been idle. Preparations had been made for
supper and everything was ready to put on the
fire when they got back. The boys were at first
disappointed because they had not brought a
prisoner back with them, but Ted soon explained
his plan to them and they fell in with
it whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>“That will mean we’ll be sleeping out in the
open for a few nights at least,” Ted told them.
“You see, when we crawl out there we’re not
going to just sit there for a few hours and then
go back into the tents. It is pretty likely that
this fellow will try his next piece of funny work
in the middle of the night, and when he does
we’ll want to be out of the camp and a whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
lot nearer to him than he thinks for. If he tries
anything more like setting the woods afire we’ll
be right on top of him before he can get very
far, and in order to do so we’ll want to camp
out and away from the tents. So tonight when
it gets dark we’ll let the fires die down a bit
and then we’ll go to our tents as though we intended
to turn in early. From in the tents we’ll
slip out the back one by one, each with his own
blanket, and we’ll make an outdoor camp in
the maple grove.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it be cold outdoors?” a boy asked.</p>

<p>“No, it won’t be. It is warm nights, as you
know, and it won’t hurt us a bit to sleep outside.
Of course, if a storm comes up we’ll crawl
back and wait until a better night comes along.”</p>

<p>After supper that night they allowed the fires
to die away to a mass of red embers and then
one by one drifted into their tents. As soon as
they entered the shelters they rolled up their
blankets, strapped them on their shoulders and
one by one raised the back wall of the tents
and slipped out into the darkness back of the
tents.</p>

<p>Here the blackness was intense and they
found that crawling was not necessary. Keeping
well to the darkness and out of the feeble
light from the fires they stole one by one to
the grove of maples and there assembled, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
all of them were in the place. This grove was of
ample size to hold them all and after some low-pitched
conversation, which Ted and Buck took
care to keep down and discourage, they spread
out their blankets and made their first attempt
at outdoor sleeping.</p>

<p>Some of them went to sleep at once, while
others, finding sleeping under the stars a distinct
novelty, lay awake for some little time.
But all of them were getting used to the camp
life by this time and it was not long before all
of them slept soundly.</p>

<p>Morning came without anything having happened
and they awoke in some disappointment.
Ted saw that he had omitted some important
part of his scheme.</p>

<p>“We should have had them sneak back in
camp and come out of their tents, just as though
they had slept there all night,” he told Buck.
“If anyone is watching the camp and sees us
come out of here, they’ll catch on to the plan at
once. I never thought of that part.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow morning we’ll have to wake
up just before dawn and sneak back, to finish
our sleep in the tents,” nodded Buck. “I’ll tell
you what we do know. Suppose we go off into
the woods a short distance and then enter the
camp from a direction back of the springs?
Then, if anyone should be watching and sees us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
come in, they’ll think we took an overnight hike
and are just getting in.”</p>

<p>“Providing they didn’t see us going into the
tent for the apparent purpose of going to sleep
there,” reminded Ted. “But we’ll do it that
way and trust to luck.”</p>

<p>They moved off into the woods and approached
the camp from a different direction from the
maple clump.</p>

<p>The day passed pleasantly enough, the boys
enjoying the camp life and the swimming. That
evening, as they finished their suppers, a beautiful
full moon made its appearance in the sky.</p>

<p>“Going to have a fine old moon to sleep under
tonight,” remarked Drummer.</p>

<p>The act of retiring to the tents and stealing
off to the maple grove was again performed and
once in the grove they sat on their blankets and
talked in low tones. The night was so fine that
no one actually wanted to go to sleep, though it
was now the usual time.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well turn in,” yawned
Ted, beginning to unbutton his shirt. The
others reluctantly followed his example and
soon most of them had slipped in under the
blankets. Ted took a final look down at the
camp.</p>

<p>The fires were low, almost out, in fact. The
brilliant moon lighted up the camp like a silvery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
lantern and the entire landscape, done in silver
and black, was hauntingly beautiful. Ted felt
a flash of annoyance at the train of circumstances
which was compelling them to spend
the night away from their tents.</p>

<p>“Too bad we have to fool around with those
fellows,” he grumbled, inwardly. “This would
be a beautiful night to lie in the tents and look
out at things. I wish—”</p>

<p>He broke off in his thoughts and bent forward,
his eyes narrowed. Then he snapped his
fingers softly and hissed. The boys sat up in
their blankets.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” Buck whispered, quickly.</p>

<p>“Get up, but don’t make any noise, on your
lives!” was the thrilling reply, in a carefully
guarded tone. “There is a figure all in white
in the trees close to the creek!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<span class="fs70">GHOST MEETS GHOST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There was only the faintest stir as the boys
followed Buck’s lead in tossing their blankets
aside and joined Ted at the bushes. Following
the direction which he had indicated, they found
that what he had said was the truth. Close beside
a tall tree, on the bank of the creek, stood a
figure shrouded entirely in white.</p>

<p>The figure was motionless at the time, intently
regarding the silent camp before him. From the
direction in which his coming lay the boys guessed
that he had come up on the far side of Bear
Creek and had crossed over the stones at the
spot where Ted had previously crossed them.
The sight of the almost dead fires and the
strange silence of the camp was giving the
would-be ghost food for thought, though he
must have expected that the boys would be asleep
at the time of his coming. For two or three
minutes, a space of time which to the boys seemed
an age, he stood looking across the cleared
space before the tents and then he began to work
his way nearer to the empty camp shelters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
keeping always close to the trees which skirted
them.</p>

<p>What his intentions were they could not
guess. He carried nothing in his hands and from
all appearances he was about to confine his efforts
at simply scaring them.</p>

<p>“Look there!” suddenly gasped Drummer.</p>

<p>They saw that he was looking off in the opposite
direction and back of the tents, but for
the moment could not make out what he had
seen.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Ted whispered.</p>

<p>“Another ghost!” was the answer. “Look,
back there in the bushes near the pine grove
where the fire was. By golly, there are two
ghosts!”</p>

<p>Now they saw what had struck the fat boy’s
eyes. It was another figure dressed much in the
manner of the one near the front of the tents,
and it was crouching in the thicket back of the
tents. As they watched it too moved forward.</p>

<p>“That is all right,” Buck said. “We’ve
known all along that there have been two of
them working together. While we chased one
of them, the other set the woods on fire. They
are both up to the same trick, and now we’ll
have to make up our minds how we’ll capture
them.”</p>

<p>“I guess we had better divide into the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
squads that we had before,” said Ted. “Buck,
suppose your squad tries to catch the one coming
from the back of the tent and my squad will
try and run down the fellow sneaking along the
trees in front. But let’s see what they are up
to first.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they think they’re going to appear
at the door of a tent and holler ‘Boo!’ to
scare us!” grumbled Buck.</p>

<p>Those of the boys who had slipped off their
shoes now hastily put them on again, happy and
a bit nervous at the prospect of the coming
action. All of them still watched the two creeping
figures below as they drew nearer the tents.</p>

<p>“I guess they are going to meet in front of
the tents and exchange signals,” commented
Buck, noting that the two men were drawing
together.</p>

<p>And at that moment they did meet, but the
boys were surprised by the result.</p>

<p>The ghost from the back of the tents stepped
out into the full glow of the moon and they saw
that his costume was slightly different than the
one which the ghost in the front of the camp
wore. There was no hood on the top of the second
spirit’s costume, but he had a cloth wound
around his head. At the same time the other
ghost stepped from the shelter of the last tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
and came face to face with the brother apparition.</p>

<p>But there was no exchange of signals, no
friendly whispering of details. For a moment
the two ghosts stood staring at each other,
seeming to shrink within their shrouds and then
the ghost from the creek tossed his arms wildly
to the sky, and uttering a wild yelp, fled at top
speed toward the creek from which it had come.
The second ghost stood perfectly still for a moment
and then shot forward, hot on the trail of
the other one.</p>

<p>While the astonished boys watched with bulging
eyes and open mouths the first ghost reached
the creek and jumped wildly for the stones upon
which he had crossed. He missed the first one
and plunged forward on his knees into a half
foot of water, to the accompaniment of a tremendous
thrashing and splashing. The second
ghost reached the edge of the creek just as the
first ghost regained his feet and made a sweeping
clutch at his shroud. There was a ripping
sound and the ghost uniform split from top to
bottom, but the ghost himself did not stop going.
Without a backward glance he ran across
the rocks and took to the woods. His pursuer,
disdaining the rocks, waded stormily in the
brook and took up the chase on the other side.</p>

<p>And now the boys in the maple grove gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
way to peals of laughter which were surely
heard by the two running ghosts. For a moment
they had been paralyzed by the strange
spectacle below them, and then the humor had
struck them as the first ghost streaked his way
across the camp pursued by the irate second
sheeted figure. The fall into the creek and the
subsequent splashing chase caused them to
laugh so hard that they were weak. In their
ghostly readings and thoughts they had regarded
spirits, ghosts and goblins as dignified
creatures, and the sight of two of them running
a frantic race appealed to their senses of humor.</p>

<p>Both ghosts had disappeared from sight as
they hurried down into the camp and went as
far as the creek, chatting and laughing over the
unexpected turn of events. The rate of speed
employed by both night prowlers made them
forget any thought that they may have had in
regard to chasing after them and they simply
hastened to the brook to see if they could hear
or see anything more of the two ghosts who had
generously provided them with an evening’s
entertainment, but all was profoundly quiet.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, that was the best thing I’ve seen
in a long time!” laughed Ted, brushing the
tears out of his eyes. “The way that first ghost
lit out for the woods was a sight I wouldn’t have
wanted to miss!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“And the other fellow snatching his night
shirt off of him was another high spot!”
chuckled Buck. “But that little drama knocks
our theory into a cocked hat.”</p>

<p>“You mean about these fellows working together?”
questioned Ted.</p>

<p>“Sure. We thought that they were partners,
but each one of them must have something in
mind and they have been working alternately
on us. Certainly if they knew each other they
wouldn’t have acted like that when their ghosts
met each other!”</p>

<p>“They certainly did shrink up at the first
sight of each other!” grinned Drummer.</p>

<p>“I guess you are right about the fact that
they don’t know each other,” Ted agreed. “But
if that second fellow ever gets his hands on the
first ghost they’ll know each other!”</p>

<p>“That was a case of professional jealousy!”
said Buck. “I have a feeling that we’ll never
be bothered with them again.”</p>

<p>“That is hard to tell,” was Ted’s opinion.
“We’ll have to await events and see.”</p>

<p>They watched the woods for a long time, hoping
to see some trace of the figures in white, but
they were unrewarded. Long after their usual
hour they remained around the replenished
fires, talking and laughing over the ghost chase.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re still a long way from knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
what they are hanging around here for,” Buck
said as they finally turned in.</p>

<p>On the following day Buck and Ted again
left the camp in charge of the older boys and
went for a hike over the mountains. They
wanted to see if there was any trace of the flight
and also to pay a visit to the hut in Hogs’ Hollow
and question Jerry Jackson point blank.</p>

<p>“For all the fun we had out of them, they still
have got to take the responsibility for firing
the woods,” Ted said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but now we don’t know which one of
’em did it! The first thing we have to do is to
find out who did what.”</p>

<p>“The quickest way to do that is to locate this
Jerry Jackson and see what he knows about it
all,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“Sure. I’m pretty sure that the ghost who
crossed the creek was Jerry Jackson.”</p>

<p>“So am I, because he fled in the direction
of the hollow. We’ll soon find out.”</p>

<p>But in this Ted was mistaken. When they
reached the crude hut of the swamp dweller one
glance inside the place showed them that he had
abandoned his home, probably for good. Everything
except the bare furniture was out of the
shack and it looked bleak and forlorn.</p>

<p>“Skipped out!” cried Buck, looking around.</p>

<p>“Yes, gone completely, and I guess we’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
never find him again. I’ll bet he is making for
new country right now. Well, that means that
we are rid of one ghost and all we have to do
is to keep a sharp watch out for the other.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be learned at the
shack in Hogs’ Hollow, so the two boys left the
place and returned to the top of the mountain.
Here they wandered along looking for any signs
which might be clues to the doings of the past
few weeks, and they passed above and beyond
the camp. They kept up their exploration until
the sun began to set and dusk crept in from the
east.</p>

<p>“We might as well go back,” suggested Ted.
“We’ve seen a lot of mountain country but
we haven’t learned anything.”</p>

<p>“All right. By the way, there is the cabin
of that unsociable gentleman down there.”</p>

<p>Buck pointed to the cabin with the barbed
wire fence and as they glanced down at it the
front door of the cabin was opened and the tall
man who resided there came out. To their astonishment
he took a board which was lying
beside the door, and placing it across the door,
drove several nails into it. For the first time
they noticed that the boards were on the windows
and that the cabin was being closed up.</p>

<p>“Hello, he is leaving us!” muttered Ted.</p>

<p>“Seems so. He has on a long coat and a cap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
Guess he doesn’t intend to come back this
season.”</p>

<p>The man went to the small shed in the rear
of the yard and opened the doors, leading out
a black horse. He then pulled from the other
side of the shed a small two-seater carriage and
proceeded to harness the horse to it. When this
was done he nailed a board across the door of
the shed and then carelessly threw the hammer
over the fence into the woods.</p>

<p>“Pretty free with his hardware!” said Buck.</p>

<p>The man climbed into the seat of the carriage,
spoke sharply to the horse and then rolled out
of the yard as the horse started off. He turned
the horse’s head toward the cities and they
gathered speed as they went. Ted grasped
Buck’s arm.</p>

<p>“Take particular notice of that horse!” he
cried. “It’s a black one!”</p>

<span class="fs70">A GAME OF NICKY NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Buck nodded at once. “It was just beginning
to dawn upon me,” he said. “Something about
the horse was attracting my attention and for
a while I wasn’t able to gather what it was. Now
I see what it is. There goes our Black Rider!”</p>

<p>“Or else his horse. It looks remarkably like
the horse on the rock. Well, if that is the
ghost who chased the Hogs’ Hollow ghost away
from our camp, what can be his game? Both
of them must have distinct ideas, because I
don’t think there can be any connection between
Jerry Jackson and that man!”</p>

<p>“When you ask me questions, ask me something
that I’ll have half a chance to answer!”
grumbled Buck. “But look at that man go! He
doesn’t look as though he is just going away
for a short time. Looks as though there was a
good reason for leaving, as though some one
is hard on his trail.”</p>

<p>“He probably has his own ideas and we’ll
never find out what the answer is,” said Ted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
“But I’m pretty sure that the fooling around
our camp is over with.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there,” nodded Buck, as
they started back toward the camp. “This man
seems to be leaving us for good and I’m pretty
sure that Jerry Jackson will be too scared to
come around again. But I certainly would like
to know what they were after.”</p>

<p>“So would I, and if we ever run across Jackson
we’ll try and make him tell us. But as for
the other one, he’s gone and we’ll never learn
anything from him.”</p>

<p>When they arrived in the camp they were
joyously received and their recital of events
was eagerly listened to. At the statement that
events of an unusual nature were over with
there was a mingled feeling of relief and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, now we can enjoy ourselves and
sleep in peace at night!” whooped Bob, tossing
his hat high.</p>

<p>“Yes, but think of not knowing what those
fellows were running around for!” growled
Drummer. “That spoils everything.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Bob. “Do we have to
know why they were playing ghost?”</p>

<p>“Of course we should,” retorted Drummer.
“When we get home we’ll want to tell people
about it and there won’t be any fun in ending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
up by saying that we don’t know what it was
all about. More than likely folks will think we
dreamed it.”</p>

<p>“We all had the same dream, then,” returned
Bob. “But it would be a lot more satisfactory
to know the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“When we go for fresh supplies of food
we’ll try and find out if anything is known of
the whereabouts of Jerry Jackson,” promised
Ted.</p>

<p>“If you don’t find anything out can we go
scouting around the country and try to find
him?” a boy asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>Ted smiled. “No, I guess we won’t go as
far as that. If he ever comes near the camp
again we will make every effort to capture him,
but I think that if we go roaming around the
mountains just with the purpose of finding him,
we will only be wasting our time and perhaps
stirring up trouble. From the looks of his hut
over there in the hollow I’d say that he had
decided to leave this part of the country for
good.”</p>

<p>That night there was a fine bright campfire
meeting and the time between supper and bed
time was enjoyed without fear of unexpected
happenings. They talked and sang and told
ghost stories, none of which satisfied them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
had the ending of the one which they had witnessed
from the maple grove.</p>

<p>“No ghost story will ever mean anything to
me again unless one ghost chases the other
across the camp and pulls his nightie off!”
laughed Buck.</p>

<p>At the recollection there was a hearty laugh
and Ted saw that the unexpected ending of the
series of mysterious events which had taken
place around the camp had cheered and brightened
them. He noted that there was a great
deal of difference in the boys. At the start of
their trip some of them had been frightened,
uneasy, panicky, but now they had changed.
All of them had broadened and looked brighter
and manlier than when they had started out.
Little Tom Clayton had developed into a
sturdy, self-reliant boy and his too-doting
mother was about to receive a surprise when
her formerly pale, angelic-looking boy returned
from the camp. Ted knew that Mr. Clayton
would be more than pleased.</p>

<p>“It has certainly done them a world of good,”
he thought, as they turned in that night. “The
whole trip has been a success, and I hope the
trustees of the club will be satisfied. Too bad
we can’t make a full report on the meddling
ghosts, but we’ll have to let that go, I suppose.”</p>

<p>On the following day he and Buck took a trip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
to the farmer’s house and there they related to
the farmer and his wife the recent adventures
which they had had. The good couple were astonished.</p>

<p>“I could have sworn it was Jerry Jackson,
after I got thinkin’ it over,” declared Farmer
Crane. “So he has cut loose and run away,
eh? I guess you’ll see no more o’ him. But
you can’t guess what he would be pesterin’ you
for, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, we can’t see why he should try scaring
us out,” Buck answered, as Ted shook his head.
“Mr. Crane, I wish you could have seen him leg
it for the other ghost, when the second party
got after him!”</p>

<p>The farmer roared heartily. “After you fellers
go, so you won’t be annoyed by curious
folks, I’m goin’ to tell that one around,” he
declared. “Too many people ’round here thinks
this Black Riders’ camp is a haunted spot, but
maybe after I tell ’em that one ghost up and
run the other out of your camp and pulled his
shirt off’n him, they’ll get a little sense into
their heads. What you think about that, Ma?”</p>

<p>His wife shook her head. “Some of ’em you
could tell anything to, and they’d still believe
that the place was alive with spooks!” she said,
wisely.</p>

<p>“If you ever hear anything from Jerry Jackson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
let us know,” Ted requested, as they were
leaving.</p>

<p>“I surer than the dickens will!” was the
reply. “If he ever comes around here I’ll make
him speak up.”</p>

<p>They left the farmer and returned to camp
with a fresh supply of food, talking over camp
plans for the balance of the summer. They had
now but a week and a half until it would be time
to return home.</p>

<p>“In all this excitement the time has slipped
by like magic,” remarked Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, Labor Day is almost here. Time hasn’t
lingered any, I’ll say that. But now that things
have settled down we ought to enjoy every
minute of the remaining time. Not that I haven’t
enjoyed it up to the present time, but we won’t
have to go running over the mountains every
once in awhile and sleeping out in the woods.
Have you enjoyed the job of managing a big
camp?”</p>

<p>“Of helping to manage it, you mean,” corrected
Ted. “I know that you’ve stood back
and allowed me to run most things, but don’t
forget that you are a partner in this. Yes, I’ve
enjoyed it and I’ve learned a lot from it.”</p>

<p>The rest of the week passed away without incident,
the boys enjoying it keenly. Now that
there was no eternal watch to be kept they felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
a lifting of a weight and from that time on they
were able to give their whole attention to their
sports and instruction. The two leaders taught
them many useful things about camp life, especially
in the matter of conscientious neatness,
and by this time every boy could swim more or
less efficiently. At night the campfire talks
were enjoyed and long, health-giving sleeps
rounded off their activities.</p>

<p>More than once the boys spoke of their enjoyment
of the mountain chase game, so much so
that Ted spoke to Buck about it.</p>

<p>“What do you think of starting a game of
Nicky Night after supper?”</p>

<p>“Fine! I haven’t played it in years! Let’s
do it.”</p>

<p>Few of the boys had ever played Nicky Night,
a game that was going out of date when Ted
and Buck were smaller. To the eager listening
group Ted explained it.</p>

<p>“Just as in the mountain chase, you go out in
groups of two,” he told them. “Only, in this
game there is no use of lanterns. In groups of
twos we’ll follow you. Now, here is the idea:
the fellows who go out first split up in twos and
drift off up the mountains, and when they have
found what they think is good ground for hiding,
they start yelling as loud as possible,
“Nicky Night!” “Nicky Night!” Those in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
camp immediately set out after them and as the
pursuing squad gets nearer the “Nicky Night”
yellers sink their voices, disguise them in every
way, and try to throw them off the track. The
two who are after the “Nicky Nights” must
touch them before they are prisoners, even if
you have to climb a tree or hang over a cliff to
do it! The Nicky Nights will stay out until the
pursuers have to give up, and then they come
in. If more Nicky Nights get in than are captured,
they win the game. You can run away
or climb trees or do anything you want to, but
the skill in the game is to throw the others off
of the track by the use of a disguised voice.”</p>

<p>The boys were keen to try the new game and
the sides were made up as at the time of the
mountain chase game. Now that Plum had left
the camp there was one short, and to make
things even one boy volunteered to remain in
camp and take care of the fires. It had been
agreed that Ted’s group would take to the
mountains this time, and they soon left the
camp in a group, to split up and spread out as
they progressed.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after they had left the camp
the first blood-stirring cry floated down from the
mountains. “Nicky Night!” came in a disguised
voice, and “Nicky Night!” was repeated
by another voice at some distance from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Buck’s squad took the field at once, and he
went off with Drummer in the direction of one
of the voices. The other groups started off
on the trails of other Nicky Nights. As Buck
and Drummer progressed up the side of the
mountains they heard the voice before them,
high-pitched and weird.</p>

<p>“That sounds like Ted,” decided Buck, as
they made their way forward. “We’ll run him
down, in spite of his disguised voice. Good
thing there is a generous slice of moon tonight,
or we’d have a tough time finding our way.”</p>

<p>The Nicky Nights before them heard them
coming and immediately began a retreat, for
the voice was next heard further off. On both
sides of them they could hear other cries of
“Nicky Night” and a few seconds later a cry
of triumph, “We’ve got you!” One set of
Nickys had been captured. The pair before
Buck and Drummer still retreated.</p>

<p>“They’ll probably take to a tree pretty soon
and allow us to go under them,” said Buck.
“That’s the thing we have to look out for.
There, what did I tell you! That ‘Nicky Night’
came from the air!”</p>

<p>The last “Nicky Night” had indeed come
from the air, a weak and treacherous cry, and
they pushed on until they came to an open
space. Here they found the house which some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
of the boys had been in and where Ted had seen
the man with the lantern roaming around.</p>

<p>“Hello, here is that old house with all the furnishings,”
exclaimed Buck.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the Nicky Nights are hiding up
there in the cupola on the porch roof!” cried
Drummer excitedly. “I just saw something
move up there. Come on and get them!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to get into that tower
room from the house,” said Buck.</p>

<p>“We won’t get in through the house. Let’s
climb the front porch,” replied Drummer.</p>

<p>“All right. But there must be a door from
the main part of the house into that cupola, and
they may escape.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ll chase them through the
house,” said the sturdy fat boy.</p>

<p>Buck stepped onto the low porch, quickly
“shinned” his way up the supporting roof support,
and reached the low front porch roof.
Drummer followed him with remarkable agility
and they swiftly crossed the roof and looked
into the little octagon cupola.</p>

<p>The moonlight sent a half light into the place
and for a single instant they thought that the
place was empty. Then, as they became accustomed
to the place, they saw a lone figure
crouching along the wall, trying to conceal itself
in the darker shadows of the little tower.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
The boys drew in sharp breaths and their skins
prickled as the man rose from his place of concealment.
He knew that he had been observed
and his hand fumbled for the knob of the door
which opened into the main house.</p>

<p>Buck had a flash of inspiration. He jumped
over the low sill into the cupola.</p>

<p>“No you don’t, Jerry Jackson!” he cried.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<span class="fs70">MYSTERIES ARE CLEARED UP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The man who stood before them, seeking to
open the door leading into the house was indeed
the lone dweller from Hogs’ Hollow. He had
heard the two approaching boys and had hidden
himself in the cupola of the abandoned house,
not dreaming for a moment that they would
enter the place. He had heard the scratching
made by them as they climbed the porch and
their appearance at the open front of the little
tower took him by surprise. For a single moment
his little eyes gleamed with an impulse
of violence, but Buck looked fairly husky and
Drummer, though short, was stocky. The man
spoke up in a high voice.</p>

<p>“What you fellers want? I ain’t done nothing
to you!”</p>

<p>“You are Jerry Jackson, aren’t you?” Buck
asked, striking a match and looking closely at
the tall, stooped old man. Jackson was past
middle age and his hair was a tangled gray
mass which hung far below the line which would
have been marked by a collar had he possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
one. His clothing was ragged beyond description.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m Jerry Jackson, but you got nothing
against me,” was the whining reply. The old
man held something behind him all the time
with his left hand and Buck had an uneasy feeling
that it might be something in the nature of
a weapon. He kept his eyes narrowly on the
man as he continued to question him.</p>

<p>“You say we haven’t anything on you, eh?
How about scaring us, cutting down our tents,
posing on a rock with a horse, and setting fire
to the woods!”</p>

<p>The man stirred indignantly. “I never did
set on no horse or set the woods on fire!” he
cried, vehemently. “I’ll tell you all I ever done
to your camp. I walked through it with a lantern
the first night you got there, and I blew
that conch shell to scare you. I was the one
who cut the ropes on your tents, because you
had to go and chase me all over the mountain,
durn yore hides! While you fellers was gettin’
a soakin’ I slipped down and cut the ropes.
Then you chased me another night when I was
hangin’ around yore camp, the night I tried to
tote off one ’o you, and somebody pegged apples
at me! But I never used no horse or set fire
to anything.”</p>

<p>“You paid another visit to the camp, the time
the ghost chased you,” reminded Buck.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if anybody set yore camp on fire,
that feller must have done it, ’cause I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Did you hang a skeleton in the woods?”
Buck asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t know nothin’ about no skeleton,” was
the dogged reply.</p>

<p>“All right, I guess I can see your part in it
all,” replied Buck. “Now, Jerry Jackson, why
did you do it? What was the idea of trying to
scare us out of a camp that was our own?”</p>

<p>The man looked uneasy and cast about him
with restless eyes. He shifted his foot and
looked down.</p>

<p>“I dunno, I must have been crazy,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“That won’t do, my friend!” Buck cried,
sharply. “You are going to speak up and tell
the truth or we will hand you right over to the
authorities! Out with it now!”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t want you boys around here
because I was lookin’ for some money that was
supposed to be hid in this house,” replied the
man, fearing to keep the truth back. “A crazy
feller named Bainbridge lived here and he died
a short time ago. I heard that there was some
money in the house and I been lookin’ for it.
Just when I was goin’ good you boys had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
come snoopin’ around. ‘I’ll get rid of ’em,’ I
sez, ‘I’ll play ghost and scare ’em back to
town.’ So I tried it, but you fellows wouldn’t
go.”</p>

<p>“No, you are right there. Was that why you
lowered a lantern down a chimney on a rope
one night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. How’d you know——”</p>

<p>“My friend saw you. Is that where you found
the money at the bottom of the chimney?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there it was—Here! Hold on! I didn’t
find any money!”</p>

<p>Buck smiled grimly at the tone of alarm. He
had observed in the semi-gloom the end of a tin
box back of the man.</p>

<p>“Yes you did, Jackson. You are holding a
tin box back of you and there is money in it.
But you needn’t worry, we won’t touch it. All
I want you to do is to go back to camp with us
and tell your story to our camp leader.”</p>

<p>“If I do, you won’t take my money or have
me arrested?” eagerly asked the old man.</p>

<p>Buck made the promise and the three of them
left the house by the stairway and took up the
journey to the camp. Both boys were on the
alert lest the man give them the slip and remained
close to his side, but he made no attempt
to get away and they reached the camp after a
silent trip. All of the other boys were in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
anxiously awaiting them. Ted hurried forward.</p>

<p>“We were just beginning to worry about you
two,” he said. “Your side won this time, Buck,
and you two are the only squad that didn’t get
your men. Who is this with you?”</p>

<p>“Jerry Jackson, the ghost—or one of the
ghosts—of Black Riders’ Camp!” was the
triumphant response.</p>

<p>His words produced a decided stir and the
boys crowded around the unhappy mountaineer.
At Buck’s command the man related all to Ted.</p>

<p>“Don’t take my money away from me, boys,”
he whined, in conclusion. “I ain’t never had
none, and I had to work pretty hard to find this.
Bainbridge is dead and there ain’t much in the
box.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want your money, Jerry,” replied
Ted, feeling sorry for the grasping, miserable
old wretch. “I just wanted to know why you
kept us on the jump. If you were the one who
set the woods on fire I wouldn’t be disposed to
be nice about it, but the worst thing you did was
to cut the tent ropes, and we had that coming,
after a fashion, for chasing you all over the
mountains. Just remember this: if you ever
bother us again when we come here, we’ll turn
you over to the police speedily, I promise you.”</p>

<p>Jackson promised never to come near the
camp again, and then he melted away in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
darkness, hugging the tin box to him. Late into
the night the boys talked it over.</p>

<p>“That explains half of it,” remarked Ted.
“But it doesn’t explain the skeleton, the Black
Rider, the groans or the fire. Looks like we’ll
never get the story of that.”</p>

<p>But the explanations came from an unexpected
source. On the Sunday before Labor
Day Mr. Calvert appeared in the camp, where
he was joyfully welcomed by the boys. He had
dinner with them and then unfolded some information
that had them listening eagerly.</p>

<p>“You fellows are quite famous,” he smiled
at them. “Did you know that you chased a
notorious forger and counterfeiter out of this
region?”</p>

<p>“No! How was that?” Ted asked.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of a Dr. Hemple?”</p>

<p>There was a swift exchange of looks. “The
name on the skeleton!” was the general cry.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded the lawyer. “This Dr. Hemple
is a very clever bank note engraver and some
time ago he began to counterfeit money and he
forged his name to checks in the bargain. While
the police of several cities were looking for him
he used to retreat up here to a log cabin he has
somewhere around and only a few days ago he
was captured. Among his confessions was a
statement that he had hoped to make this region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
his headquarters, but that a camp of boys had
refused to be scared out and he couldn’t have
men coming and going with a boys’ camp near
here. So he left the place and was later caught.”</p>

<p>“I remembered the troubles you had had at
the camp and I went to see this Dr. Hemple.
He told me of the skeleton and about groaning
in the bushes and of setting the woods on fire.
Oh, I know that you are wondering about the
Black Rider part of it, too! He heard that Ted
was going to tell the story and that gave him an
idea. He muffled the feet of his horse and led
him out on a rock—that one over there?—and
then put some illuminating powder on the top
of the rock, which he touched off. He hoped
you’d think he was a dread spirit of the place,
but you refused to be scared away. But what
is his story of another ghost? He says he
masked one night to try and scare you away as
a ghost, but he claims that there was another
ghost around.” The lawyer looked puzzled as
the boys broke into peals of hearty laughter,
and Ted told him the story.</p>

<p>The lawyer enjoyed it thoroughly. “Well,
you certainly have had a wonderful summer of
fun and adventure,” he remarked, and later he
spoke privately to Ted and Buck. “You boys
have done a fine piece of work here. All of
these boys look in the pink of good health, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
as for that little Clayton lad, his mother and
father won’t know him. He has developed physically
and he bears himself like a little man,
in contrast to his former timid way. I am proud
of the way you have handled these boys and
the other trustees are going to be, too.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” acknowledged Ted and Buck,
pleased with Mr. Calvert’s praise.</p>

<p>On Labor Day they enjoyed their last few
hours of camp life and as soon as the big truck
arrived they pulled the supply truck up to the
road and the boys took their places in the big
vehicle. This time Drummer was in charge of
the boys and Buck rode in the front seat with
Ted. With a final cheer for the camp of the
Black Riders the trucks started down the road
and back toward the city.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m mighty sorry to leave the camp,”
remarked Buck, as they rolled slowly along.
“I’ve seldom had a better or more exciting
time in my life.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” agreed his chum, with enthusiasm.
“Black Riders’ Camp will always have a soft
place in my heart.”</p>

<p>The boys in the truck seemed to feel the same
way. The country road rang with their cheer
for the recent camping trip.</p>
